  <h2 class="title">Dangerous Curves Ahead</h2>
  <p>&quot;If it weren't for Curves, I wouldn't be here today.&quot;</p>
<p>Judith, the beautiful black contestant on Dr. Phil's Weightloss Challenge, appeared to me in a dream last night, larger than life. Or maybe smaller than life. Whatever.</p>
<p>&quot;Just look at me!&quot; she said, and I had to admit she looked fabulous. &quot;Who wouldn't want some of this?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;So, it's not Dr. Phil's bars and shakes, after all?&quot; I asked. &quot;You're telling me it's the exercise?&quot;</p>
<p>I was worrying a bit for her reputation. What if word got back to the Dr. Phil Show that Judith had become a circuit-training, jogging-in-place advertisement for Curves? Weren't there conflict-of-interest issues at work here?</p>
<p>&quot;I'm telling you,&quot; she said, &quot;if it weren't for Curves, I might not be alive.&quot;</p>
<p>That Judith is one persuasive woman! I hopped out of bed and started to pull on my exercise clothes, repentant and freshly motivated. Too late, I realized it was too early...Not even Curves is open at four a.m.</p>
<p>I decided to check the online news, which was--surprise, surprise!--plump with juicy tidbits about <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2004/04/29/EDGAB6C1IO1.DTL">Curves</a>. Evidently, the evil owner of the world's fastest-growing franchise, Gary Heavin, has been donating a portion of his hefty profits to pro-life organizations. In fact, he and his wife contributed $5 million to a couple of crisis pregnancy centers in Texas last year.</p>
<p>For this, he is being vilified by a columnist at the San Francisco Chronicle, who attempted to link him to militant pro-life groups, but who was later forced to add a &quot;clarification&quot; (whatever happened to the word &quot;retraction&quot;?)to her piece.</p>
<p>So I sat in my shorts and t-shirt, one shoe off and one shoe on, and exercised my right to tell columnists and editors exactly what I think. I wrote three letters before my heart rate returned to normal, and was pleased with myself for having gotten in my aerobics for the day.</p>
<p>I may not find the time to haul my sorry you-know-what back to Curves anytime soon. But I won't let my membership lapse just yet, either.</p>
<p>Somewhere in Texas, there just might be a little kid who will someday sound like the Judith of last night's dreams.</p>
<p>&quot;If it weren't for Curves, I wouldn't be here today.&quot;</p>

    <p class="comment-text">Very nice, Katy. Made me think of this quote from New York magazine, in an article about the availability of high-resolution images of unborn babies via sonogram: "Indeed, such vivid pictures are potentially worrisome to abortion-rights-activists, who fear that presenting a cute, childlike face on a fetus may hurt their cause."</p>

    <p class="comment-text">Maria, Let me just say congratulations on graduating from med school! You are my hero...  
  
Mary, What a powerful quote! Thanks for posting it here. A "hurt cause" would be a good thing.

    <p class="comment-text">As of May 13, the San Francisco Chronicle was forced to publish corrections on three or four specific errors in articles published by two writers about Curves. So far, the Curves execs haven't decided whether or not to sue. I got an email from Curves thanking me for my letter writing, and one from Ruth Rosen, writer for the Chronicle, who didn't seem thankful. Tee, hee.</p>

    <p class="comment-text">Excellent post, Katy. I find it amusing that at this point, the "corrections" are almost as long as the article.</p>

    <p class="comment-text">Lisa, what good is a woman without a cause?  
  
Sarah, Opinion pieces are all well and good, but when the author doesn't do the simplest kind of fact-checking, 000hhh....retractions rule!
