  <h2 class="title">Blow By Blow</h2>
  <p>One of my <a href="http://www.nancymoser.com">best friends</a> has nine or ten novels under her belt, and she's a great mentor to me as a writer.</p>
<p>When I was working on my first novel, though, she expressed how mystified she was with my technique--or, I should say, lack of it.</p>
<p>I wrote scenes as they came to me, without regard for where they would ultimately occur in the story. After I'd written about 65 scenes, I spread the index cards describing the sections out on the floor and put them in the order that made sense to me.</p>
<p>&quot;You did <em>what</em>?&quot; Nancy asked. &quot;Ummm...do you have a problem with writing in chronological order?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Girl,&quot; I answered, &quot;I have a problem <em>living</em> in chronological order.&quot;</p>
<p>Imagine the kick I got out of the <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&amp;cid=499&amp;u=/ap/20040622/ap_on_en_ot/clinton_book_review_1&amp;printer=1">book review</a> Jerry Schwartz wrote about Bill Clinton's memoirs.</p>
<p>The reviewer says that reading the book feels like being locked in a tiny room with a gregarious man, and being forced to listen to him recite his appointment book from 1946 on, boring entry by boring entry. <em>Ouch.</em></p>
<p>&quot;Part of the problem,&quot; Schwartz says, &quot;is that <em>My Life</em> is relentlessly chronological.&quot;</p>
<p>That's the problem with my life, too, and the reason why, apart from blogging, I think I'll stick to writing fiction.</p>
<p>And, just in case, not in any particular order.</p>

    <p class="comment-text">So my blog was on a server that was hacked into over the weekend, so it has been offline since Saturday. I am having to surpress the need to write in it. Bloggers Anonymous anyone?  
  
Anyways, I find myself, when writing about things that happened, going in chronological order. It is totally opposite, thoguh, when telling a story orally. I skip all over the place. Pretty crazy.

    <p class="comment-text">I've tried fiction before. I don't think it's my thing. I wrote a story called "Cleopatra's Wings" about an interracial couple. The man gets amnesia and wakes up in the hospital and discovers he's married to a black woman. He remembers enough to know he's not a bigot but can't figure out why he's uneasy about her. There's even a twist at the end. I sent it to 5 publications, all rejected it, but one editor wrote a personal note with suggestions. Writing fiction is just too hard!</p>

    <p class="comment-text">Last night our pastor read a verse from 1st Timothy. Then he said something like 'God speaks to us through those who write.' I don't claim to be on a par with the writers of the Bible. I don't claim to be speaking for God, at least not always. But what if...? I'm saying what if...?  
Writing is hard. Fiction is hard. What's hard about it is that we put our hearts into it and nobody seems to care. The way we know they care is that they spend money for it.  
But what if...? What if somehow in our cracked, twisted way we speak for God. We say something in a way that reaches someone who would never read a Bible or listen to a sermon?  
Maybe if we can't sell it, we should give it away.

    <p class="comment-text">Kevin, Chronological is good, as long as you leave out the boring parts! (I love the quote by the writer--I forget who--that goes "When writing, I try to leave out the parts that nobody reads.") Good advice, huh?  
  
LaShawn, It is hard. I'm still not sure I can get good enough in what's left of my career span to make a go of it. An editor at Zondervan told me that it takes, typically, ten novels before an author actually starts making money for the publisher. That's a lot of novels, baby!  
BTW, what you do is having a huge effect. If you keep going through open doors, your writing/speaking will have a huge impact. I'm so excited for you, I've ordered Star Parker's latest book!  
  
Angus, Yes. The Scripture that I try to write by is in Jeremiah 15. It's God speaking. "If you will extract the precious from the worthless, you will be my spokesman." It's a full-time job, this extraction business!
