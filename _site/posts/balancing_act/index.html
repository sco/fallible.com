  <h2 class="title">Balancing Act</h2>
  <p>The caller to Dr. Laura had been living with her boyfriend for two years, and had found out through several people that he referred to her as his &quot;friend from work.&quot; She was devastated.</p>
<p>&quot;He doesn't think of you as a keeper,&quot; Dr. Laura said. &quot;Why don't you leave him?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I'm scared to be without him,&quot; the caller said. &quot;I'm scared to start over.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Would you rather be permanently used or temporarily scared?&quot;</p>
<p>This got me thinking about similar exchanges a person might be asked to weigh.</p>
<p>For instance, seven or eight years ago, I had several book proposals considered by publishers, and then had them subsequently fall through the cracks. The proposals, not the publishers. My ideas weren't formally rejected or completely accepted; rather, they were positively appraised before becoming irretrievably lost.</p>
<p>This process made me feel oddly invisible, a feeling I hesitate to reproduce by submitting my current book ideas to publishers today.</p>
<p>&quot;Would you rather be permanently unpublished or temporarily invisible?&quot;</p>
<p>I really hate invisible, but it's got to hurt less than unpublished, so that's my choice.</p>
<p>How about you? How would you fill in the blanks after the words <em>permanently</em> and <em>temporarily</em>?</p>

    <p class="comment-text">would you rather be temporarily poorpoorpoor while living the life you feel compelled to live, or be permanently (at least for the forseeable future) employed in a job that steals the time to consider the meaning of "vocation"?<br><br><br>oh, and katy: invisibility can be fun. you have more freedom to create without pressure.</p>

    <p class="comment-text">I just read this and don't really have a good this or that...it just reminded me of a book I read a year or two ago about a young boy who goes on a quest. On the way he sojourns with a shop-keeper who actually likes the idea of a quest more than a quest and so never leaves. Thus, he cannot be disappointed. He haunts me. The book is called "The Alchemist" by Paulo Coehlo.</p>

    <p class="comment-text">i don't have an answer to your question, but i had a dream last night which featured you and your daughter (difficult, as i don't know what either of you look like). your daughter was helping me lead a bible study for some younger girls. lol. i hope it is a sign of something good. :)</p>

    <p class="comment-text">Tim, I will read The Alchemist, though even the idea of it haunts me already. Thanks!<br><br>Annie, I knew you would think thusly...<br><br>Jake, I do, too. But He does sometimes jolt me with questions...<br><br>Kari, Scroll down a ways to a post about my Carrie, and you will see her photo. She'd love to help you teach those girls!</p>
