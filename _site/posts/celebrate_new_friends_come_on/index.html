  <h2 class="title">Celebrate New Friends, Come On!</h2>
  <p>When you survive brain surgery, you instinctively know there must be a reason why. Because really, truly, you don't exactly expect to survive.</p>
<p>But today I celebrate my five-year anniversary of not only surviving and remaining tumor-free, but also embarking upon a life I had only imagined until that time. A life of improved health, renewed youth, and a greater urgency to fulfill God's purposes for my life than I'd ever known before.</p>
<p>Imagine how great it was last night to celebrate my anniversary in style--by meeting up with fellow bloggers <a href="http://lisasamson.typepad.com/">Lisa</a> and <a href="http://willzhead.typepad.com/">Will</a> Samson in Baltimore and spending a great afternoon and evening with them! Doug and I came away inspired both by their passion for God and for all those who need Him so much--even down to a couple they'd never met before, us.</p>
<p>Then today, while Doug was at a training seminar, I read an entire Lisa Samson novel, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1578565987/qid=1100561971/sr=2-1/ref=pd_ka_b_2_1/002-5564945-4691245">Tiger Lillie</a>. I knew, knew, knew Doug would walk in from his long day right when I got to the climax, and I'd feel really bad about having to say, &quot;Oh, honey, can you wait just a couple mins to talk? I'm dying here! You can't believe what is happening in this book.....&quot; and sure enough, that's what happened!</p>
<p>But Doug knows me well. He gave me the two minutes it took to finish the book, and the five minutes it took to recover from having finished the book, and then we went to dinner and I told him all about it. But I'm not telling you! You need to read the book and become a Lisa Samson devotee in your own right. I know I'm one!</p>
<p>Thanks, Will and Lisa. We love you guys.</p>

    <p class="comment-text">Lisa's book had a strange effect on our relationship. I walked in the door and Katy said "Don't talk to me!" Once she recuperated from the intense ending our normal relationship continued with the phrase "Take me to dinner!

    <p class="comment-text">Katy - (and Doug) what a great reason to celebrate! May you have scores more anniversaries like this, to enjoy with new friends and old. Blessings</p>

    <p class="comment-text">And we love you guys too. From the moment we pulled up at BWI I felt like we had connected with new friends, and every new conversation, every new stream of thought, our entire time together just confirmed that. Now we need to find some excuse to plan a trip to Kansas City to hang out on your turf. (-:</p>

    <p class="comment-text">Will: The K&D B&B is open for business. Here's the plan: for your M.Div. thesis, write on emergent church in KC at Jacob's Well. Better yet, write on the emergence of great barbeque in KC. (Its all about primary research.) God bless you guys!</p>

    <p class="comment-text">Katy-that's awesome. I have to say also that because of your surgery your son helped me through a lot of doubt when my father had his open heart surgery. There is a reason for everything. A bigger picture that we can't see. I love you!</p>
