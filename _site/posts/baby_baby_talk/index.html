  <h2 class="title">Baby, Baby Talk</h2>
  <p>Doug and I occasionally eat breakfast at a geezer hangout not far from our place. It's the kind of joint that makes a great cup of plain old coffee, the kind of establishment where no one--waitresses, cooks, or customers--knows the meaning of the word <em>barista</em>.</p>
<p>When we're in one of those <em>nobody can screw up eggs</em> moods, this is where we go.</p>
<p>I'm observant enough to have realized that most of the patrons are old coots in farmer hats, that no women eat there without men accompanying them, and that couples are rare.</p>
<p>It's all geezers, all the time.</p>
<p>On some level, it had sunk in with me that all the waitresses were middle-aged, meaty bleached-blondes, whose nametags read <em>Tammy</em> or <em>Rhonda</em>. And while those features would have been sufficient to attract this restaurant's clientele, I'd never noticed the piece de resistance until the other day.</p>
<p>Rhonda sashayed our way with the coffee pot, from which Doug had already imbibed deeply, and started pouring.</p>
<p>&quot;Honey,&quot; I said, keyed in to the fact that he was overdoing it on the caf, &quot;you've had so <em>much</em>....&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, he's OK,&quot; Rhonda said. She leaned over, pursed her lips, filled his cup to the brim, and patted him on the hand. &quot;He was a fursy boy.&quot;</p>
<p>She trotted off to the next geezer and I looked at my husband and said, &quot;Did she just call you <em>fursy</em>?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yeah,&quot; he said, pouting, &quot;and I liked it.&quot;</p>
<p>I took a good look around and saw a dozen smiling geezers pulling out their wallets and plunking down hefty tips.</p>
<p>I gotta get me one of those name tags.</p>

    <p class="comment-text">here in our little town, i get a rather large kick out of the close to twenty rusty pickup trucks parked outside of our grocery store every morning...and the overalled, oversized baseball hatted geezers swapping conversation straight out of a farmers almanac, black coffees in hand in the corner set up with a few diner style tables. i've been informed recently that this area is referred to as "the wind tunnel" and have yet to figure that one out. born and raised a city girl, i still think it's all so novel and wish i could screw up the courage to ask them if i could photograph this quaint daily meeting - "lord of the combine, the fellowship of the geezers" (i do hope i haven't offended anyone here :)</p>

    <p class="comment-text">i may be urban, but there is something so "home" about a place like that. where you know what everything on the menu is and tastes like. there is no guessing, but you can just nod your head and say, "the usual." "fursy" might have been a bit over the top, though...i'm just saying.</p>

    <p class="comment-text">Fursy was lost on me, too, until I read the comments. Huh.</p>

    <p class="comment-text">Sadly, "fursy" didn't even cause me to pause; of course it means thirsty. I only wish there were a high-paying baby-talk interpretation position open somewhere in the world. I'd be making the big dollars for sure. As it is, I'm probably just well-suited for grabbing the sticky hands of my young charges and heading out to hang with Rhonda and the geezers. Bring on the bacon.</p>

    <p class="comment-text">We had a Thanksgiving tradition of every other year going to Dallas to visit my side of the family. When my youngest stepdaughter was about 14 we ate Thanksgiving morning at IHOP, the only restaurant open.  
  
My stepdaughter wanted a biscuit and gravy and the well traveled waitress with the deep southern drawl patted her on the head and said, "Aw the lil' girl wanna bicket?"  
  
Now any time anyone asks for a biscuit now in our family... the bicket story is regurgitated.  
  
Maybe cutsy talk pays well for the geezer set, but I swear I thought that Thanksgiving my 14 year old was gonna deck the old broad.

    <p class="comment-text">Tim, What could be the harm in divulging the name of the joint? Oden's Family Cabin. Yes, it is a log cabin restaurant, which I cherish the very thought of....Hey, you're definitely not a geezer, and the only little detail about my story my hub objected to was when I said that "Rhonda moved on to OTHER geezers..." Tee, hee.  
  
Lisa, Your geezer hangout sounds wonderful! How about a picture book of small town geezer sightings? I would so buy it! Guess what? Your fellow barista Brooke ate dinner at my house last night! We spoke highly of you!  
  
Brooke, Yeah. Fursy is over the top, at least for me. But now that you've had a chance to talk to Doug, perhaps you see how he might enjoy it! ;) Great fun to see you last night!  
  
Amber, I'm glad you and Kelly spoke up! Doug says maybe I should have written "firsty", but darn if the woman didn't say fursy. Goofy, huh?  
  
Mary, Rhonda and the Geezers would make an excellent name for a rock band, as Dave Barry would say! I enjoy reading about your nanny experiences. My daughter was a nanny for several summers, and loved it. Keep the bacon coming, and those kids will turn out great.  
  
Michael, OMG, I laughed at this! Future generations of your family will still be saying "bicket" a hundred years from now, and no one will know why. Keep the story alive--it's a great one.  
  
When I was 18, my grandparents took our large family out for Easter. I was dressed to the nines, 3-inch heels, etc. The waitress at the CLASSY hotel where we ate asked if I wanted the "sketty" or the "roni cheese" or the "chicky leg". I asked, "Don't I have to be 12 or under to order those?" "Well, yes," she said. I was ticked off, but how I wish I could hear those beautiful words again..... ;)
