  <h2 class="title">Book of Common Share?</h2>
  <p>Since we purchased a Sleep Number bed by Select Comfort a few years back, we haven't had a headboard--just queen-sized mattresses on a frame. I miss my antique Ethan Allen cannonball bed, but not my crummy mattresses.</p>
<p>When herniated disks and fibromyalgia set in, sacrifices must be made. Sigh.</p>
<p>A couple of weeks ago, we made up for our lack of a headboard with matching floor-to-ceiling bookcases. His and hers, one on each side of the bed.</p>
<p>There was a time when a peruser of our eclectic 1500 book collection might have imagined one or both of us to be multi-faceted, well-rounded readers. When we divided our books along party lines, the truth became evident.</p>
<p>His:<br>
The Bible<br>
A Brief History of Time (From the Big Bang to Black Holes) by Stephen Hawking<br>
The Elegant Universe (Superstrings, Hidden Dimensions, and the Quest for the Ultimate Theory) by Brian Greene<br>
Euclid's Window (The Story of Geometry from Parallel Lines to Hyperspace) by Leonard Mlodinow<br>
The Quark and the Jaguar (Adventures in the Simple and the Complex) by Murray Gell-Mann<br>
The End of Physics (The Myth of a Unified Theory) by David Lindley<br>
The Last Three Minutes (Conjectures Avout the Ultimate Fate of the Universe) by Paul Davies<br>
Icons of Evolution (Science or Myth?) by Jonathan Wells<br>
The Genesis Question (Scientific Advances and the Accuracy of Genesis) by Hugh Ross<br>
Anti-American Terrorism and the Middle East by Barry Rubin and Judith Colp Rubin<br>
Church History in Plain Language by Bruce Shelley</p>
<p>Hers:<br>
The Bible<br>
Memoirs of a Misfit by Marcia Ford<br>
Traveling Mercies and Bird by Bird, both by Anne Lamott<br>
The Artist's Way and The Right to Write, both by Julia Cameron<br>
Making a Literary Life by Carolyn See<br>
How to Write a Damn Good Novel by James Frey<br>
How the Irish Saved Civilization by Thomas Cahill<br>
The Oxford Book of Ireland by Patricia Craig<br>
Atkins for Life by Dr. Robert Atkins<br>
The Idiot Girls' Action-Adventure Club (True Tales from a Magnificent and Clumsy Life) by Laurie Notaro<br>
The Proper Care and Feeding of Husbands by Dr. Laura Schlessinger<br>
Damn! Why Didn't I Write That? by Marc McCutcheon</p>
<p>No separate beds for us, but separate bookshelves? A dream come true.</p>

    <p class="comment-text">When I made my move to Missouri, I was forced to throw out (rather, donate to a used book store) more than 300 books... All loved children of mine that were waiting for a floor-to-ceiliong bookcase of their own... "One day," they mused. Alas, they finally got their bookcase. Just not in my home. I miss them.

    <p class="comment-text">tim, that's such a sad story. i have a the same one from when i left chicago and college life for the great unknown (which turned out to be kansas, which is right in the middle of everything, though it sure doesn't seem like it most times)...katy, your top three match mine perfectly! and dougs...well, dougs would have me out cold before i turned the first page, i'm afraid...if i even braved picking up a copy of just about anything in his collection. :)</p>

    <p class="comment-text">Tim, I, too, am in mourning over your lost books. Rarely have I gotten rid of a book I didn't miss later--unlike clothes or almost any other material thing. What's up with that?  
  
Lisa, Doug says his books help "relax" him, which is hilarious. He's the most naturally relaxed man I've EVER known. His books keep me awake. Just knowing one of them is in the same bed with me makes me tense. ;)

    <p class="comment-text">If ever someone analyzed our bookshelves, they would think I was the therapist living with/analyzing the serial killer. All of Jim's books talk about how to kill people and mine show you how deal with those people who do. (My other books tell me how to write about it!) People would think we were both crazy!</p>
