  <h2 class="title">All In A Day’s Housework</h2>
  <p>For about two years, I paid to have my house cleaned. The first two girls came recommended. Their names were Jennifer and Heather, from a little podunk town even littler and podunker than the town I live in on the edge of Kansas City.</p>
<p>Jennifer was in charge, and I liked her too much to believe she'd last long. I was right. One day, Heather showed up with Chelsea and starting that day Heather--clearly not as accomplished a domestic diva as Jennifer--was giving orders.</p>
<p>Chelsea decided to become a nurse tech so she only showed up three times, if I remember right. But Heather seemed to have no lack of friends, and Rhonda took over where Chelsea left off.</p>
<p>Rhonda was OK, but by the time she came on board it was hot outside and her shorts were short enough and her cleavage deep enough that I kind of wished my husband didn't work at home anymore. Of course, if he rented office space we couldn't afford house cleaners, so it was kind of a draw...</p>
<p>But then again, Rhonda didn't last. The last time I saw her she was leaning over some expiring flowers near my front porch, explaining to Doug that she was going to start her own landscaping business and that she'd love to have him for her first client.</p>
<p>Like I said, we never saw her again.</p>
<p>The first time Heather showed up with Skye, I knew I'd soon be cleaning my own house again. For one thing--and I apologize in advance if your name happens to be Skye--the new girl was one of those chicks who doesn't have a last name. I never even asked, although I'd known Heather's last name from day one. Skye is like Madonna without maternal instincts, or a mono-syllabic version of The Artist Formerly Known As.</p>
<p>You don't ask for her full name, because you know in your heart the answer will be, &quot;It's just Skye...&quot;</p>
<p>Sure, it is.</p>
<p>Heather and Skye haven't been around for several months. They were supposed to come a couple days before Scott and Brooke got married, and they'd been penned in on all of our calendars for two months. That day, I waited and waited and finally reached them on the incoming-calls-can-only-leave-messages and-we'll-call-you-back strange prepaid cell phone the two of them shared.</p>
<p>&quot;We've been trying to call you,&quot; Skye said. (We'd been sitting by all the phones, waiting for any one of them to ring.) &quot;Our car broke down. Can we come tomorrow instead?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No,&quot; I said. That was all I said. There was no time for idle chit-chat. I had a huge house to clean, an out-of-town guest on her way, a rehearsal dinner to throw, and a son to marry off.</p>
<p>We haven't heard from them since, until today.</p>
<p>Skye called on her funky outgoing-calls only phone and Doug answered. Tears fell from the Skye as she told her sad story so loudly that I could hear her three rooms away and I'm half deaf. Doug kept saying in that kind and sympathetic way of his, &quot;You're kidding...&quot; and I kept yelling loudly enough for her to hear me, &quot;That's right, she is!&quot;</p>
<p>Call me a fair judge of character, but I was not surprised to find out from my brother-in-law the cop that while there are several warrants out for Heather's arrest, she is not now nor has she been in jail.</p>
<p>I've heard of financial planning, but attempting to raise bail money before you even get busted is over the top.</p>
<p>My house was never too clean when they worked for me. So now it's dusty, and they're not getting my $1200.00</p>
<p>That's right. They tried to extort $1200.00 bail money from my good-hearted hubby, and nobody's even in jail.</p>
<p>I'll tell you, with some people, the Skye's the limit.</p>

    <p class="comment-text">Jim, the cop, says that your blog is a "cute little play on words!" My feeling is...I'm glad Doug got the scoop on Heather and Skye from Jim before he doled out any cash to them. Jim will make sure to tell Heather "hello" when he arrests her on that warrent! Ah..the pleasures (and fun!) of small-town life!
