  <h2 class="title">Church Hopping</h2>
  <p><img src="http://www.fallible.com/img/stainedglass.jpg" alt="Stained">I just purchased <em>Memoir of a Misfit: Finding My Place in the Family of God</em>, by Marcia Ford.</p>
<p>On the way home from Barnes and Noble, Doug asked what it's about.</p>
<p>&quot;It's about a woman's struggle to hang on to God, even though she's never quite felt she fits in anywhere.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What do you mean, she doesn't fit in?&quot; Doug is not thrilled with this topic, I know, since he fits in well wherever he finds himself, blooms where he's planted, and well...you get the idea.</p>
<p>Is it my fault he chose to marry a misfit?</p>
<p>&quot;She was raised a Baptist, became a Charismatic, and now attends a liturgical church.&quot;</p>
<p>He bristled slightly at the word &quot;liturgical,&quot; and since I enjoy it when he bristles, I went on.</p>
<p>&quot;Liturgical's not against the <em>rules</em>, you know,&quot; I teased. &quot;Liturgical's <em>OK</em>...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, <em>liturgical's</em> OK,&quot; he agreed smoothly, his voice losing all its apprehension. &quot;Just not <em>lethargical</em>.&quot;</p>
<p>I'd follow him anywhere.</p>

    <p class="comment-text">I will, Lisa. So far, it's not as humorous as I'd hoped, but hauntingly real the way she describes her childhood, etc.<br><br>Linnor, Welcome! Thanks for the link, and come back often, please. Now I'll go read your site (your pic of your family is beautiful!).</p>

    <p class="comment-text">Okay, Katy.... two things, neither of which have anything to do with this particular blog post:<br><br>1) I read your November 7, 2001 entry. I almost laughed out loud.<br><br>2) When can I read this novel? ;)<br></p>

    <p class="comment-text">katy, if you haven't yet, you should read "girl meets god," by lauren winner. it's quite good, and i actually thought of you when i was reading it - that you'd enjoy it. it's alternately amusing and touching. (lisa, you should read it too, if you're so inclined. or anyone really! :) )</p>

    <p class="comment-text">Michaela, You're going THAT far back with fallible? Wow. I love you! Glad for any entertainment value I can offer. THAT novel is on a back burner with a blown element--it was a first attempt. My recent attempt at a novel is similarly languishing--or maybe I'm the one languishing? I'm having a crisis of confidence, at the least.<br><br>Bethany, Scotty gave Carrie "Girl Meets God" for her bday in March. I really want to read it! Now I will for sure. Thanks.</p>

    <p class="comment-text">hey katy,<br>let me know how memoir of a misfit is. i've debated buying it since i saw it come in at work. working in the stockroom at b&n, i see at least half of the books we carry when they come into the store. at least half. ;)</p>

    <p class="comment-text">i am reading \_girl meets god\_ right now! ha. small world. i want to write a book like that. lauren winner has stolen all my ideas though. (except for the whole jewish theme. that wasn't part of my ideas.)<br><br>(and annie loves liturgy.)</p>

    <p class="comment-text">Sara--I finished Memoir and it's great. It's an older lady's story (she's maybe 53?) so I can really relate to it. We share lots of the same church experiences. Sometimes, I gasped aloud at the similarities.<br><br>Annie and Kari, I started Girl Meets God yesterday and love it so far. Thanks for recommending it! Annie, your style is so your own, there is no stopping you from writing your story!</p>

    <p class="comment-text">there's a great interview with lauren winner in the current mars hill review (i get mine at b+n, it's in with the writing magazines) - i also picked up girl meets God and am starting it today. katy, i do believe you have a little book recommendation/discussion group thing going on here at fallible ;)</p>
