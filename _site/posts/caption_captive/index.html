  <h2 class="title">Caption Captive</h2>
  <p><img src="http://www.fallible.com/melee2.gif" alt="melee ahead">A recent hobby of mine is to catch all the typos I can while using closed captioning for the hearing impaired. (I'm completely deaf in one ear, and hear well with the other. The captions usually help ease any strain.)</p>
<p>&quot;Look at that!&quot; I'll shout at Doug and the kids, who are entranced by the visuals and can't believe I'm hung up on a little word. &quot;Who types this stuff? Haven't they mastered sixth grade spelling?&quot;</p>
<p>In the case of the State of the Union Address, wouldn't you think the speech would have been made available to the typist even only minutes beforehand, so he could get it right? And by the morning after's news, the hearing impaired should definitely be able to count on reading an accurate version of a twelve-hour-old speech.</p>
<p>On this morning's Today Show, the president was quoted from last night's speech as saying, &quot;Trusting in the sanity of Saddam Hussein is not a strategy.&quot;</p>
<p>The caption read, &quot;Trusting in the sanity of Saddam Hussein is not a tragedy.&quot;</p>
<p>We're the targets of closed-caption terrorism, and we can't even hear it coming.</p>

    <p class="comment-text">hey, that's my hobby at the Y, while i'm treading rubber and listening to the cd of the day...i need something else to do at the moment, too, so i watch the t.v.s out of the corner of my eye. Absolutely amazing to me how bad the spelling mistakes are...you'd think that typist learned his or her craft exactly the same way I did (i'd never make it as a secretar...um, 'corporate liasion'...hmmm...

    <p class="comment-text">I do it, too. I use the closed captioning because the kids I nanny are too loud for me to hear a word of anything...including the kids' shows. It's a pretty sorry state of affairs when the nanny is more interested than the kids are in the conclusion of "Arthur" on PBS.</p>

    <p class="comment-text">katy, i was thinking the same thing about the state of the union! i had made myself go to the Y (b/c i am responsible \*and\* health conscious) and i actually got one of the elliptical trainers in front of the TVs! i was very excited. then, the state of the union came on. closed captioned on four TVs. this is not the stuff of athletic motivation. i was very distraught, however, much entertained by bush-isms rendered worse via closed captioning</p>

    <p class="comment-text">OK, this raises a question. Does anyone know how closed captioning is actually accomplished? Scotty says he thinks it might be mostly a result of voice recognition software, not a person (or people) sitting there typing away. Voice recognition might explain why when Bush said the words "may lay," the text read, "melee"!! Which, BTW, was very meaningful, in context!</p>

    <p class="comment-text">i'm not entirely sure, but i have always thought it was voice-recognition as well. that would be a crazy job, though, wouldn't it - what do you do? i'm a closed captioner!</p>

    <p class="comment-text">ah, bet's link provides the answer, and explains the "m?l?e" problem. live stenocapturers were probably used for the SotU, but their shorthand system works phonetically.</p>

  <div class="comment">
    <p class="comment-text">For those of you who are wondering captions are generally done the same way that speech is recorded in a courtroom. A stynographer types out everything that is said, then a computer turns that shorthand into normal text. <br>people make mistakes. I'm amazed at how many people think it's voice recognition software, That technology isn't here yet (I wish it was though).</p>

    <p class="comment-text">I use to be an electronic graphic operator for an ABC affliliate. The fonts for me to type would often be given to me too late for me to correct mistakes that I saw I made. Especially sports scores....I would struggle during commercial breaks to get them in and into a sequence, all the while more would be handed to me even as the sports anchor was speaking.</p>
