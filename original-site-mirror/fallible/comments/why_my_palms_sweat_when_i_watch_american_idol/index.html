<h2 class="title">Why My Palms Sweat When I Watch American Idol</h2>
<div style="clear:both;"></div>Last night marked the beginning of my fourth season as a bona fide American Idol addict.<br />
<br />
Only on American Idol can you hear contestants say things like, "I just found out I can sing two weeks ago. I've never even practiced this song before. Can you believe it?"<br />
<br />
Only on Idol does someone preface her tryout with the words, "God already told me I'm going to be the next American Idol," and then, when she gets turned away by four judges who don't happen to include--or even agree with--the Almighty, she cusses them out on camera.<br />
<br />
And where else can you witness a woman gyrate through a teeth-jarring version of "I Feel the Earth Move" before she moves on to dis the opinions of the judges? "They're just WRONG. They don't know me! I WILL make a CD, they'll see. My mother and all my friends say my voice is AMAZING!" Oh, it was amazing, all right.<br />
<br />
Then there's the poor girl who actually has a modicum of ability, but who had to hawk her wedding rings to get to the auditions and whose husband is, let's just say, unsupportive. He didn't want her to audition, but since the judges voted to put her through to Hollywood, he guessed he'd go along with it. "It's her dream," he said, none too enthusiastically.<br />
<br />
And what about the guy who said he's Toni Braxton's cousin? He put a bit too much faith in heredity, don't you think?<br />
<br />
Of all the types who show up at Idol auditions, the ones that shock me most exude a kind of brash, unfounded confidence that has nothing to do with skills and talent, and (evidently) everything to do with somehow believing they're entitled. <br />
<br />
For all the parents out there who don't give their children an ounce of encouragement, there must be many more who incite their progeny to believe they can do anything, win any contest, achieve any dream--and all without the slightest bit of training or discipline.<br />
<br />
Which brings me to why my palms sweat while viewing this show: It's just that the gazillion-to-one odds these kids face remind me so much of the odds of being happily published. And not only that: I realize more and more with each passing season precisely what's involved in becoming (notice I didn't say "being") a successful contestant.<br />
<br />
I've got to wonder if editors and agents, as they meet with wannabe writers at conferences and slog through unsolicited slush piles of unuseable submissions, don't feel a bit like Randy and Paula and Simon must after a long day of harrowing auditions. Because, from what I've observed, wannabe writers often exhibit behaviors just like those of wannabe Idols.<br />
<br />
This season, if you want to be published like I do, let's learn a few things from American Idol. Let's work on our craft, enjoy as many good books as we can gets our hands on, get input from peers and mentors, take lessons and follow instructions, and write like we've got something to prove.<br />
<br />
Because you know what? Sometimes, even if we've come to expect otherwise, "yes" is exactly what Simon Says.<br />

<li>Well, at least you're not a Braxton cousin -- you've got that going for you; my goodness! :-/<br />
<br />
In any case, I'm sure your &quot;judges&quot; will be much more welcoming of the work that you produce! <br />

<li>The truth is that Toni Braxton's cousin could probably get a book published.  I read about somebody who got their first book published at 45 and I get excited.  Then I find out they knew somebody who knew sombody or they are a friend or relative of somebody famous.<br />
<br />
The most disappointing thing, though, is reading the stuff that not only gets published but makes lots of money.  Dan Brown, David Balldachi, Mary Higgins Clarke (I'm probably stepping on somebody's favorite author) are examples.  They aren't authors.  They're writing factories.  Those starving artists paintings aren't done by real artists.<br />
<br />
I need a sofa size novel that will go with a teal color scheme.

<li>My favorite has to be the last contestant on the first night who heard all the voices in her head...that was classic!  I'm already hooked, though, I have to admit, bad singers and all.  Those few that were good (like the one chick from St. Louis who was the farm girl...loved her!) keep me coming back for more.  Tonight's The Apprentice...another favorite.  This season is the college educated vs. the street-smart.  My vote is on the college &quot;kids&quot;...should be fun! :)  Miss you, too, Katy...too busy with doctor stuff  and work lately.

<li>Oh God!  I watched it, too.<br />
<br />
I couldn't believe the girl who thinks God wants her to sing.  Maybe He does.  He did NOT however, say she was going to be America's Idol.  Some people just can't handle that kind of responsibility, and apparently she lacked the sweet and gentle spirit of current idol Fantasia (though I've been known to rip an expletive, myself), but what got me was when she got on her knees and begged the judges.<br />
<br />
Ouch.<br />
<br />
Perhaps she'd have been better off dropping to her knees and talking to God about the whole thing.<br />
<br />
On writing:  If it's for us, we have to trust God's timing.  He's just not cooperating with me by doing things MY way.  But He sees us writers as an eternal God would see us--through eternity.  He allows us the beauty and the terror, knowing what we WILL be.  All things working together for the good, and alla dat.<br />
<br />
Just give it to Him.  Let Him do with the work what He will, and don't forget to ask for the daily bread, but only the bread for the day.  Not for the five year portion.<br />
<br />
Much love, Katy.

<li>Another less strident thought:<br />
Some people think Noah got the dimensions, the materials, the knowledge, and the skills to build the ark from God.  The whole package.  I don't.<br />
<br />
He didn't have a hammer or nails or a miter saw with a lazer light.  Hw wouldn't have known how to use them anyway.<br />
So he built a rowboat.  It fell apart.  He biult another.  It sank.  He built a bigger boat with two floors.  He put some coes on it to test it.  It fell apart.<br />
It took a long time to build the ark because he had to build a LOT of boats.  But he kept trying.  And learning.<br />
<br />
When it started raining, he and his family held thier breaths waiting to see if it would float.  The future of the human race depended on it.  Imagine the structural engineering knowledge required to build something that would support two elephants, two hippos, two rinnos, etc.  Noah in the end still had to trust God.<br />
What's that quote?  Work like it all depends on you.  Trust like it all depends on God.<br />
God desn't expect us to keep secceding.  He just expects us to keep trying.

<li>I lost track of these wonderful comments somehow! I am commiserating with those who feel American Idol angst, and am taking to heart the advice given here about writing (singing, acting, teaching, whatever) with our hearts in the right place. Thanks!

<li>Oh my gosh!  I have been watching the new American Idol contestants.   Now I know what I would sound like standing up there, totally<br />
tone deaf and belting out &quot;Hello Dolly&quot;.

<li>Candace--But the difference with you is that you caught yourself in time!!!! This is why God made showers, in my opinion--to give those of us who shouldn't inflict pain on others a place to sing our hearts out!
