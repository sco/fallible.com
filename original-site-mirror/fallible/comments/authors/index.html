<h2 class="title">Authors!</h2>
<div style="clear:both;"></div><a href="http://www.fallible.com/writers-photos.html"><img src="http://www.fallible.com/images/8ladies.jpg" alt="Eight Lovely Ladies" width="150" height="100" hspace="0" vspace="4" border="0" align="right"></a>I have SO never live-blogged an event before, and technically I guess I'm still not going to, since live-blogging is really more like instant messaging than I'm used to, but here goes!<br />
<br />
Some of the most wonderful authors in Christian fiction today are gathered here at the Grand Opening of the new <a href="http://www.parable.com/cbg/">Christian Book and Gift Store</a> in Olathe, Kansas. Who knew they'd have wifi? Since they do, by golly, I'm going to take advantage of it.<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.fallible.com/writers-photos.html">Doug's snapping some pics</a> while I'm getting to meet a couple of ladies I've emailed with for some months now. <br />
<br />
My good buddy <a href="http://www.nancymoser.com">Nancy Moser</a> has just introduced me to <a href="http://www.colleencoble.com">Collen Coble</a>, <a href="http://www.deborahraney.com">Deb Raney</a>, and <a href="http://www.renegutteridge.com">Rene Gutteridge</a>. Fun ladies, one and all! The store is also hosting <a href="http://www.stephaniegracewhitson.com">Stephanie Grace Whitson</a>, <a href="http://www.judithmccoymiller.com">Judith Miller</a> and <a href="http://www.hannahalexander.com">Cheryl Hodde</a>, the female partner of the husband/wife writing team who go by the pen name "Hannah Alexander." I am new to the fiction of these last three authors, but not for long.<br />
<br />
I must say the women are creating a pretty good buzz here today, and that being a part of it is exciting and inspiring. <br />
<br />
Let's see how they respond to an impromptu interview:<br />
<br />
<div align="center">____________________________</div><br />
<b>Nancy</b>, I understand you have a new release called "A Place to Belong." Is it a stand-alone book or part of a series?<br />
<br />
It's the fourth--and last--book in the Sister Circle series I co-authored with Vonette Bright.  It wraps up all the stories started in the other books--quite a feat as each book added characters!  And truthfully, I will miss the "sisters".  We've become very close.  :o)<br />
<br />
<b>Deb</b>, didn't I just hear today that you are a finalist for a RITA award for "A Nest of Sparrows"? Congratulations! Will you be able to go to the award ceremony?<br />
<br />
Yes, I am, Katy, and I'm thrilled. So many of my wonderful author friends have won the RITA in the past and that has made it such an honor. I hope to be able to go, but unfortunately there are several conferences during that time and SOMETIME I have to finish a book!!<br />
<br />
<b>Colleen</b>, you were a finalist for last year's RITA awards! Did you get to go to the RWA (Romance Writers of America) ceremony, and how great was that?<br />
<br />
It was like being at the Oscars! Totally amazing. They had my cover up on a huge screen, I was dressed in a formal dress and had my handsome husband beside me in a Tux. My kids came as well. It was something I'll never forget. I felt really special for that night and it was an exciting time to share with my agent, Karen Solem, and my editor, Ami McConnell, as well. It was glitzy and fabulous.<br />
<br />
<b>Cheryl</b>, I know you represent half of the Hannah Alexander writing team and that you're part of a writers group called Chi Libris. Can you tell me what the members of your group accomplish when they meet?<br />
<br />
Oh, wow, What we accomplish! We connect as family. There's a synergy that happens when we're together. You may not believe this, but writers are a weird bunch, and so many people misunderstand us. That particular creative story process is always a part of us, and it spills out into our "normal" lives. With ChiLibris, we understand. We support. We love and encourage. It's not about professional connections or self-promoting. It's about that much needed connection that happens whenever we're together.<br />
<br />
<b>Rene</b>, you do comedy and suspense novels, right? So, are your comedy books suspenseful and your suspense books funny? Do you really have a split personality, or what? And are your readers mostly female or male?<br />
<br />
I always tell people who are interested in writing to incorporate both!  My comedy has suspense and my suspense has quite a bit of humor.  I think the comedy helps develop the character and the suspense always makes the plot stronger.  But I have been accused of having a split personality, too!!  (Mostly from my husband.)  On the third question, my readers tend to be almost equally split.  I have been amazed at how many men read my Boo Series!  And of course I have both men and women who read the suspense series.   <br />
<br />
<b>Stephanie</b>, why should a serious minded Christian bother reading fiction? Don't we get everything we need from the Bible and works of non-fiction? What's the big deal with story anyway?<br />
<br />
Story can penetrate the heart and mind a way that "just the facts" cannot.  I think it's probably common for everyone to have that gap between what they know to be true and what they live out, regardless of their belief system.  Story has a way of getting past my intellectual "no" and impacting my emotion -- and, therefore, story can have a unique ability to shape my own life.  In the Old Testament, when a prophet challenged King David about his personal sin, he didn't do it in a judmental way at all.  He didn't point the finger.  He simply told David a story.  David was outraged by the behavior described in the story. . . and when he realized he was guilty of the same kind of behavior, he was driven to repentance.  The prophet used a story.  I think that kind of power is trans-generational and trans-cultural.  All cultures have their own stories, and their power to change lives is a wonderful thing.  I know people who could never tell a friend how to fix a problem with Bible in hand and a doctrinal thesis.  But they can share a novel on the subject with that same friend and impact their heart and mind for good.  Fiction can have a ministry in the lives of people who would never listen to a sermon, never attend a Bible study.<br />
Of course good fiction should ideally point the reader TO the uultimate source for life -- which is God's Word.  <br />
<br />
<b>Judy</b>, you've been co-authoring novels with Tracie Peterson for three years now. How in the world do you ladies make that work? Don't you have to have compatible styles and rhythms? I just don't get it!<br />
<br />
Actually, you're correct in that co-authors need to have compatible styles and also beliefs in their project. Tracie and I get together to plan a detailed synopsis and then I write the first draft. After the draft has been completed, I e-mail it to her for her input and suggestions. Then she e-mails the updated version to me for my input. Once we've agreed on the finished product, it's sent to the publisher. We are both historical writers, but one person generally needs to be responsible for the primary research and detail. That is generally the person who will write the first draft. I have heard of instances where authors will write chapter by chapter. However, Tracie and I have found this method works best for us. It has been a truly enjoyable experience. However, we both write indepently also. <br />
<div align="center">____________________________</div><br />
<br />
There you have it, you fiction lovers, you! Many thanks to all the lovely authors who took part in today's book-signing and live-blogging event. It's a pleasure to make your acquaintance!<br />

<li>That sounds like so much fun!

</li>



<li>Amber--It was an absolute blast! For a writer, there's nothing more stimulating than being around other writers. I shouldn't have gotten Starbucks on the way home, because now I'm hyped! How is your book coming? You'll let me know when and where to show up for book signings, I hope?  :)

<div class="posted">Posted by Katy Raymond  &nbsp;on&nbsp; 03/27/05 &nbsp;at&nbsp; 08:39 AM</div>

<li>Katy, Thanks for thinking of the blog while you were there!  I enjoyed your post and it looks like it was so much fun.  One day you and I will be the ones with the pens and the fans.

<div class="posted">Posted by Lori Seaborg  &nbsp;on&nbsp; 03/27/05 &nbsp;at&nbsp; 12:27 PM</div>



</li>



<li>Oh, if only one had more time in a day to write! I fear I'll never get this book finished, unless I find a rich supporter and quit my day job. But I will certainly let you know if a book signing is ever in my future. ;-)<br />
<br />
I had considered making a trip to Olathe, had this not been Easter weekend and already full. Being around other writers is definitely one of those stimulating experiences that I love to dive into!

<li>Great job, Katy!  Kudos for your terrific coverage of this event...it was the next best thing to being there.
