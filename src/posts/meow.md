      Hehe. Kids rock.  
        
      I've been to the Starlight Theatre! I'll be in KC this weekend, as a matter of fact. I was so thrilled to hear that Don and Lori will be playing there again after I had to miss the farewell shows.  
        
      \[Sorry to litter your comments with that...I guess I just needed to share my joy.\]

      I don't \_know\_ Scott but I know \_of\_ Scott. I only had to be around the Swim Team boards for a few days when I first joined to hear his name several times and recognize that webmaster=Sco. Since then, I've visited his personal site and admired his adventures from afar. =)  
        
      The show was great this weekend, by the way! I'm writing up a review now.

My sister Mary had a couple tickets to see Cats at the Starlight Theatre in Kansas City the other night and decided to take her three-year-old grandson, Connor.  
  
She figured they'd only stay until intermission, and walk to the car while it was still daylight. She hoped Connor wouldn't realize they were missing the last half, since if he did he might beg to stay until the end.  
  
Turns out, within forty-five minutes of the show starting, he was ready to blow out of there.  
  
"Grandma, let's go back to your house now," Connor said. "Those cats are making me nervous."
