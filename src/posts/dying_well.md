      This funeral seems much more meaningful than those I have attended, even though most of them were for Christians.  
        
      I've been hearing great things about John Piper and his books; are they as good as people say? My library doesn't seem to have any so I haven't had a chance yet to see for myself.

      Grief and the way we cope with it often defines bravery.  
        
      Not knowing anything more about these men then what you have written, I was curious , so I did a news search to learn more.  
        
      The story I found opened with a quote from Cindi Sue Lombardo. It is an astounding testament to the strength of faith.  
        
      "They did not have an accident; they had an exit to heaven," she said.

      Sarah, The funeral was a testament to this family's faith in Christ--but that's what their lives were, too. Amazing people. I'm reading, and being changed in the process, my first John Piper book. I purchased it the day after the boys died, in honor of them. God is truly using it to change me, and I'm grateful...  
        
      Amber, The deaths of these men--dear friends of ours--has been humbling. God is moving in so many lives because of the Lombardo family.  
        
      Tim, Oh, so many tears...  
        
      Michael, Thank you for this link. I hadn't seen this particular article, only the ones in the Kansas City Star and the many TV interviews Cindi granted. She is an unbelievably strong woman, just as strong in the face of death as she's always been in life. Her strength has as its source a true faith in Jesus...a more tested faith than I've ever personally witnessed.

      Mom-  
      It's hard being here in Columbia because I am distanced from those who knew them...but reading your blog ables me to cry again. I loved them so much, but even more, I love thinking of them in Heaven with our Savior.

      Um I think Ozzie is a spammer...  
        
      I was sort of proud yet still offended when I got my first and only spammer in my comments area. I was angry but I also thought "Gee, either my tiny little blog must be getting more hits than I thought, or these spammers are really getting desperate."  
        
      Yeah, I eventually settled concluded the latter too....but it was good while it lasted.

[![](http://www.fallible.com/img/lombardosT.jpg)](http://www.fallible.com/img/lombardos.jpg)"Death makes visible where our treasure is. The way we die reveals the worth of Christ in our hearts...the essence of praising Christ is prizing Christ. Christ will be praised in my death, if in my death he is prized above life."  
John Piper, *Don't Waste Your Life*  
  
Three enormous photographs stood high upon easels in the front of the church, focal points for the thousands of mourners who came to share their loss of Butch Lombardo and his two grown sons, Guiseppe and Nino.  
  
Slowly, the pallbearers processed down the center aisle, the reluctant bearers of three caskets. Each casket was placed beneath one of the portraits and covered with flowers before the men stood in a solemn line to kiss the widow, the mother, the tightknit family's soul survivor.  
  
Then the time of worship began. One guitarist, several singers, leading us into the Savior's presence, word by word, note by note, pointing us once again to the giver and the taker of life.  
  
For the people in the front rows, though, the portraits obstructed their view. As much as they needed to see the beautiful faces of the men they'd lost, they needed even more to see the face of their God reflected in the countenances of the singers.  
  
One by one, the pictures were removed--by the mourners themselves--from their places of prominence on the easels. Nothing stood in the way of Christ being praised even in death.  
  
It was exactly what the boys would have wanted.
