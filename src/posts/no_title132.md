    text: "Jonathan--I thought that must be the literal meaning--god from the machine--but I still didn't get it. Thanks! No, things will not be wrapped up that conveniently, I'm afraid. I plan on God from Heaven being the One to ultimately resolve the confict, if the characters will allow Him to. A couple of them are pesky."

    text: "deus ex machina is a literary device that uses an unexpected character or event to resolve a conflict or change the direction of the story. apparently, in greek drama, a character playing a god would sometimes be lowered from the sky with a machine in order to resolve conflicts. thus the name for the device \"deus ex machina\" or \"god from the machine.\""

    text: "Madi--Will you publish your story when it's done? Will any of it be on your website? I'd love to read it when the time comes. The nice thing about nanowrimo is that it frees a person to \"dump\"--get it all out on the table, and worry about the finer points later. Now that that's over, I've got a whole lot of worrying to do! Thank you!"

    text: "Jonathan--OK, I'm going out on a limb here. I think I'm going to keep going with my story, since there's quite a lot that will be cut, and more that must replace the cuttings. After that, I think I will finish the story with a period. PLEASE help me with \"deus ex machina\"! I feel so illiterate. Thanks!"

    text: "Bethany--But it is a really cool feeling to do it, and find out you can! I realized the failure/despair thing was a distinct and likely possibility, but felt I could risk it right now. Now I feel like I'll make a bolder attempt at writing, and have a chance at a modicum of success. Wouldn't even a modicum be lovely? Thanks!"

    text: "wow! its amazing to me, that these excerpts, compelling as they are, have been the fruit of a month long, unkempt spewing forth...well done. i'm curious, prior to this month, how difficult was it for you to resist editing along the way? on a scale of 1-10 maybe..."

    text: "Rachel and Bethany--I had only the vaguest idea of a story, and one character--Erin--in mind. I wouldn't advise this! But with full-time school, and only finding out about NaNo about a week before starting, I had no time to plan. Writing can happen without a plan, of course, but it's not necessarily good writing! And, yes, any month can and should be NaNo! Having a partner would make it work."

    text: "and the really fun thing is that any old smelly month could be nanowrimo, couldn't it? how bout it bethany? how bout raging against our machines? i'm about a -3 on the scale. i got into a bad habit early in highschool of sitting down at the computer two nights before a paper was due and pasting it all together on got-a-deadline-breathing-down-my-neck adrenaline. you said you already had a basic character sketch and plot down before you started, right?"

    text: "Rachel--Some unkempt spewings turn out better than others! Scale of 1-10, with 1 being easy to resist editing, I scored a 2. I knew if I didn't keep spewing, I wouldn't get the word count accomplished. It really is interesting and effective way to do a first draft of sorts. Thanks!"
