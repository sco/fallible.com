When Mom moved to the assisted living place, she took only enough possessions to furnish a one-bedroom apartment. Now she's happy she included the stiffened-fabric-and-resin Scottish Santa Claus my son gave her last Christmas. She displays it, as I do mine, year round. "What brand is that one?" I asked last night, during our short visit. The two well-known makers are Fabriche (pronounced like the French would, with a long "a" sound at the end) and Possible Dreams. I took a peek at the tag. "Fabriche," I announced. "Faberge?" my mother asked. "Fabriche," I repeated, with a perfect 4-years-of-French accent. "Faberge!" she exclaimed, with joy. I kissed her then, and left, and smiled all the way to the parking lot, happy she felt so enriched by our little talk.
