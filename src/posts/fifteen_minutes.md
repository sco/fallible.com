      You're probably getting hit with a ton of comments today. Don't worry, we'll all get bored and move on soon to the next big thing.  
        
      I have thoroughly enjoyed what I have read of your articles. I am a Christian writer wanabe. I have an embarassingly large connection of books on writing, some of which I have actually read. I also have some of the books on your husband's top ten list, a strange combination. You don't tell just anybody that you have read a book on the history of geography (or as we used to say back in Arkansas, the histry of gagraphy).

I have my own that I have kept since the end of my Junior year in high school(I just finished my freshman year in college). I will definitely keep coming back to read your blog!"

      Angus, "Some of which I have actually read..." I can SO relate! I forget which famous American author said something like "I now have an extensive collection of more than 800 books, most of which I wrote myself." A wannabe writer--and writers in general--has to hang on to his good humor! Best wishes.  
        
      Bridgie, I know I'm sometimes PG, but PG13? I had no IDEA! Perception is everything, huh? Tee, hee. Hey, guys! Click over to Bridget's site. She's a wonderful teacher, great writer, and all around fun chick.  
        
      Kevin, My youngest son is Kevin also! Great name. I'm glad you started blogging young. Keep it up! Thanks for visiting here, and please do come back. I'll try to keep you updated on my 19-year-old Kevin.  
        
      Susan, Your blog is shaping up nicely. I'll keep checking in to see what books you're reading and recommending. Great stuff!

      Terri--Wow! How fun to hear from you! You can take a boatload of credit (Hey, everybody! Terri is my college creative writing instructor!), since you helped restore my confidence soon after I'd had brain surgery, and encouraged me to make a real stab at novel writing. If it weren't for you, I might have decided to pursue a degree in math or geography...tee, hee. Thanks, T!  
        
      Kevin--Do you know how few people have ever claimed to read my essays? Thanks!

      Hi, there...I'm a lurker, long-time reader, but not from the article. Discovered you some other way a while back and am certainly glad I did. Congratulations to you on your inclusion in the article. It's well deserved for a woman so talented and able to communicate the essence of a thing so brilliantly. I find inspiration here nearly every visit.

      Katy,  
        
      I had to laugh at the 20-somethings audience in the article. I sure would like to think that I am "20-something", but alas I more like 40-something. You do have at least a couple of "old farts" reading, because I turned my 50-year-old friend on to your blog too. I appreciate your writing very much.  
        
      P.S. I have read your essays too.

      Shawn, Welcome! I'm always a bit embarrassed when I realize how many preachers and worship leaders read my stuff. I'm no theologian, but it's possible I represent a typical 50-year-old woman who occupies a church seat on Sunday and attempts to follow God the rest of the week. Pretty scary, huh? ;)  
        
      BTW, old farts are definitely the best farts!

[Tim Engle](http://timengle.blogspot.com/), a writer for the Kansas City Star, is a new blogger. And this isn't just any blog. It's a blog he started to orient himself to the experience of blogging, and to document all the stages the newspaper went through during the production of his piece on Kansas City bloggers.  
  
I want to thank Tim here for allowing me to be a part of his story. Today's paper runs the piece in the [FYI section](http://www.fallible.com/kcstar6-04excerpt.html), and includes excerpts from fallible, a bio, a quote or two from yours truly, and a couple of pics.  
  
Tim truly immersed himself in the blogging world to pull together his story, and it really isn't his fault that after my mother read it, she said, "Katy, you've *never* said that word to me before. What is it again?"  
  
Hey, if you're a new visitor here, [post a comment](http://www.tecknik.net/blogback/data/bb.php?blog=1496815&post=108652909484721929) so I'll know who you are! And I apologize in advance if you came here because you saw the "warning" in the Star about the high potential for adult content.  
  
You'll find a few references to bras and panties, but other than that, fallible doesn't merit much caution at all!
