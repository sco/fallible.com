There's a new study out that shows that diabetics are 85% more likely to develop Alzheimer's than non-diabetics. 85%!  
  
I lived on the edge of diabetes for many years before coming to my senses. Diabetes itself didn't scare me too much back then, although God knows it should have with my family history, but Alzheimer's? Now *that's* a scary thought.  
  
I've suspected for years that a lifetime of disproportionate sugar consumption might be a leading cause of Alzheimer's, and this study seems to substantiate my theory.  
  
And to think my theory was based largely on the fact that when I eat sugar, I am spaced-out, forgetful, and occasionally incoherent. Not that I've eaten any recently--it's been more than four years, and I've never felt better. My blood sugars are completely stable as long as I stay aware from the white stuff.  
  
So, the way to largely prevent Alzheimer's (and who knows? possibly to reverse it in its early stages if eating habits are changed)is to avoid acquiring diabetes. And the way to avoid acquiring diabetes is to stop consuming simple sugars.  
  
What are we waiting for, people? Don't imagine that the sugar industry and the pharmaceutical industry are going to let their favorite addicts go easily. They'll fight to discredit this study to the bitter end.  
  
It's apparent that the brain you save will have to be your own.
