      I am laughing out loud right now. Ha! :)  
        
      Sounds like you are doing the world of high-carbers proud!

We've eaten an inordinate amount of Italian food in the past five days--first in Baltimore's Little Italy and then a couple more times in DC. Not only that, but we visited the World War II Memorial, where I couldn't help but focus on the conflict in Sicily, since my dad spent years there with the British Army.  
  
Still, even I was surprised that when Doug used the word "miscellaneous," I managed to hear "Mussolini-ish."  
  
I'm sorry, but that's just scary.
