      Tough call. It can be a blessing, but it can \*definitely\* be a curse. You put something out there and then people are free to attack it, which can feel like they are attacking you.  
        
      You are such an amazing writer about God's kingdom already - if you want to expand what you write about, I would just do it here and in your style. How do those issues affect your life? How does it impact your "family stuff, church stuff, Jesus stuff, and friend stuff" - that would be a good blog.

      Hi! I've been reading your great blog for three weeks and it's one of the few on the Net that I truly enjoy...so thanks!  
        
      I just began blogging a couple weeks ago and I, too, felt compelled to share what is going on in politics. I often link to www.townhall.com/columnists/ for their very eye-opening observations. This is a whole other side of me which suprises my friends, yet again, it \*is\* a side of me which I need to share.  
        
      So I so go for it! And I think it would be fine to include your political views here in this blog since they, too, are a part of who you are as a whole person and sharing them is another way to help spread truth to others.  
        
      My blog, by the way, is at http://debrasthoughts.blogspot.com/ I hope you'll stop by ... :o) Oh, and I've presented some pretty radical political stuff, but so far no one has slammed me for it. I've heard only thanks.  
        
      Just my 2 cents... Thanks again...Debra

      Sounds like a good place to rant to me...take the first step and see where it goes.  
        
      Personally, nothing ever turns out how I envisioned it anyway so I'm sort of used to working on the fly :)

I'm thinking of starting a second blog, one with more topical specificity.  
  
(By the way, I just now discovered that *specificity* is a very fun word to type. I suggest you try it, just for fun. It gets your left hand, which for you may be your less dominant hand, going all fast and furious and even a little spazzy. Specificity. Oh, yeah. *Very fun*...)  
  
On fallible, I mostly write about family stuff, church stuff, Jesus stuff, and friend stuff. Occasionally, I write about writing.  
  
I don't often get into commenting on current events, politics, conservatism, liberalism, terrorism, money, fad diets, or scrapbooking. But I could. I *really* could.  
  
Knowing what you know about me, and having read what you've read, do you have a suggestion for a second blog, a companion to fallible, one with a significant dose of topical specificity?  
  
I trust your judgment.
