      Oh, but there are so many more than 5, Katy!  
        
      I'm feeling in a listy mood today:  
      1\. My wife, Julianna  
      2\. My father, William Samoff  
      3\. Denver Smith (now deceased coworker/mentor)  
      4\. Grandmother, Mary Samoff (now deceased)  
      5\. Jesus  
        
      I've been trying to figure out what to do for years now. :)

      Here's goes nothing...  
      My husband, Jim  
      My best friend since age 5, Amy Latenser Nagle  
      My 8th grade teacher who inspired me to teach and made learning fun, Mike Maloney  
      My principal who hired me in Warrensburg and was my mentor as a writing teacher, Kitty Brant  
      The 17 year old teenager who rear-ended me 2 1/2 years ago and has forever since changed the course of my life, Jesse Barber

      Tim--Trust me, when you're my age, you'll still be trying to figure out what to do! I have loved reading about your grandma Mary on your site. She is wonderful!  
        
      Bridget--The thing I noticed first about your list (before actually reading it) is that the first four people you call "My" and the last one you refer to as "The." Says a lot about how you feel about them, huh? And how did none of your illustrious neurologists make the cut? With so many to choose from? Eeeeek. Love you!

If you've never thought about this question, maybe you should. When I was faced with it, I was shocked by my answers. If you respond honestly and somewhat off-the-cuff (don't stop to think too long or you'll come up with the answers you think you "should" give), you will learn more about yourself than you might in many sessions of therapy:  
  
Who are the five people, living or dead but personally known by you, who have had the biggest impact--positive or negative--in your life?  
  
I'm not posting my people here, at least not right now, but you can if you'd like. I predict that you, too, will be surprised by who makes the cut.  
  
Of course, then the question remains: Now what do you do?
