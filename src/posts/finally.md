      i just love how you nurture the child inside, katy...i'm constantly trying to grow mine up, dragging her into adulthood with a tight hand and determined chin. thanks for not only letting yours be, but delighting in her - a good reminder for me.

But you should have seen the silly grin on my face as Doug and I assembled the dollhouse and I unpackaged all those Barbies (a redhead, brownhead, two blondes, plus a black Barbie with her very own baby!) I was EVERY BIT as thrilled with my toys as when I was eight, maybe more. If there's something you've always loved, my advice is to keep on loving it."

Wasn't that nice of them? They could have given me, I don't know, a fresh tape for my Code-a-phone. They catered to the kid, and I never forgot it."

      Katy, I spent the day after Thanksgiving drooling over Little Kiddles in an antique store. You may or may not remember these miniature Mattel dolls. They sold for $60 a piece at that store. I had tons of them as a girl, and eventually passed them on to nieces. But I would have bought everyone of them that Friday if they had been reasonably priced. So. I had my fill, and still long for them.  
        
      And then there was Dancerina across the aisle... (Am I sounding nutty or what?)

I also have my Revlon bride doll I got for my 8th Christmas, but I look at the Revlon dolls in the antique stores longingly...so you're right. Even if we have our fill...sigh."

      Tim, You are very secure to refer to your action figures as what they are--dolls. Is your wife OK with this? ;)  
        
      Bridget, Well. You might as well know that our sister Liz had a real Barbie. A more thorough waste of a beautiful doll was never committed...

      Katy, I haven't been able to convince myself to get a Barbie doll because I know it would just sit there and gather dust and be in the way... arrgh! My parents have infected me!!! (they are super-practical people with not a single sentimental bone in their bodies)  
        
      ...plus Barbies still cost $30 and the really gorgeous ones cost even more. \*sigh\*  
        
      I draw girls who look like Barbie. It's the only thing I can draw. I've always always been fascinated by beautiful women :)

      Irene, If the infection your parents passed to you hasn't cleared up by the time you're my age, I'll be surprised. Over time, your immunity will build up and you'll fight it off! By then, your children will be struggling to not catch the stuff you're trying to pass on....  
        
      Fascinating that you draw Barbie women! I am drawn to beautiful girls, too. Most of my friends are drop-dead gorgeous. I know a therapist would have a hey-day with this....

      Lisa, Oh, yeah. You'll find a way to play. I can tell.  
        
      Irene, Not every woman can be as tasteful as we are!  
        
      Ivy, I had somehow lost track of you, girl! Now I'm back with the Ivy program...missed you. There's no reason why Barbie and feminism should be mutually exclusive, IMO. ;)

    text: "I actually found your blog by searching for blogs that mention dollhouse! =) I'm a dollhouse miniaturist, and have lots of other miniaturist friends online.. it's great to have a second childhood.. I'm currently customising my Barbie, and planning to buy her some friends, too. My main scale is 1:12, though (smaller than Barbie scale)."

Not long ago, a side-walk sale at Wal-Mart compelled me to haul home no fewer than a dozen Barbies to add to the stuff in the gift closet. Last night, I opened five of them and made them my own.  
  
It's a difficult thing for a woman of my age and feminine sensibilities to never have had a *real* Barbie. Barbie was introduced in 1959, I believe, when I was in kindergarten. By 1963, when I was allowed to have an anatomically correct (tee, hee) doll, fake Barbies were already on the market.  
  
I got a platinum blonde, pony-tailed unreasonable facsimile, and my life was changed forever.  
  
It's like what they say about cravings: No amount of filling your stomach with a crummy substitute takes the place of a small amount of the real thing.  
  
I have spent decades purusing the Barbie aisles, showering other children with the Barbies I never had, drooling over the gilded designer Barbies the Franklin Mint now sells to over-aged Barbie-deprived women with bucks.  
  
It's pathetic, really. My poor mother tried to save fifty-nine cents by purchasing the fake rather than the shockingly expensive $2.48 authentic, and she instead caused a lifetime of Barbie angst.  
  
I had no choice but to give myself the gift of Barbies last night. I had to have something to fill my new Barbie dollhouse.
