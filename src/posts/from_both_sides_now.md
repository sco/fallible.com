      Oh mom...You know I'll never forget when you and dad told us kids that we could no longer watch the Simpsons. Of course, we were stunned as we walked downstairs the next day and opened the door to you and dad laughing hysterically...to the new episode of the Simpsons. It's kind of been a family show since then, huh?

      Postmodernism hits us all smack in the face as clouds belong to cartoons and familial conversation travels by numbers.  
        
      It's making me all warm and fuzzy feeling inside! :)

The sky was the brightest autumn blue, the clouds horizontal, fluffy white tinged with gray.  
  
Doug, Kevin, and I were racing down the highway, on our way to Kev's soccer game.  
  
"Look at those clouds," I said. "Aren't they dreamy, aren't they fabulous?"  
  
The guys agreed, and we all spent several silent seconds mesmerized, hypnotized, in love with all of nature and even in awe of each other.  
  
"You know what they remind me of?" Kevin finally asked.  
  
We waited for his insightful, poetic interpretation until, after a pause, he lifted his voice and began to sing.  
  
"The Simp-sons...."
