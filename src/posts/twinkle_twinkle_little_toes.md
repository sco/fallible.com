I planned to check in this Christmas Eve morning, just to say Merry, Merry and Happy, Happy. But I awakened with my toes twinkling, and that usually means I'm trying to remember the fun thing that happened right before I fell asleep.  
  
"Hey, babe," Doug had said, and it must have been well after midnight, "I've got a blog up for you."  
  
"I'm too sleepy," I groaned. "I'll read it tomorrow..."  
  
The twinkling toes reminded me to check his blog, and as always, the toes were right! It's five minutes later, and they're still twinkling.  
  
Enjoy [Doug's entry](http://marginal.typepad.com/marginal/2004/12/lights.html), and Merry Christmas from both Fallible and Marginal Comments!
