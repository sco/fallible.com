One to the \"Christian Reader.\" And two to upcoming volumes of Chicken Soup. I'm excited to get my feet wet again! Scotty says he thinks you're going to major in English--do you intend to be a writer? I can't think of a better thing to intend to be."

I will blog more, but at least while I'm not blogging, I've been submitting some articles to publishers--something I haven't done in about 5 years. So I'm pumped, girl!"

The [San Francisco Examiner](http://www.examiner.com/sfx/templates/printer.jsp?story=n.statue.0113w) reports that, "A statue based on the famous photograph of the flag-raising at the World Trade Center site is being criticized because the three white firefighters in the picture have been transformed into one white, one black and one Hispanic." The article goes on to voice the opinions of those on both sides of the controversy, and includes statements from a fire department spokesman, a lawyer for the three men in the photograph, the lawyer for the newspaper that holds the copyright to the photograph, and the president of the company that is paying for the creation of the statue. My personal favorite, though, is the quote by Kevin James, a member of the Vulcan Society, a group representing black firefighters. "The symbolism is far more important than representing the actual people," he said. "I think the artistic expression of diversity would supersede any concern over factual correctness." The subjects of the original photograph never asked to be "represented," and in fact have reportedly turned down opportunities for interviews around the world. The picture wasn't really about them, and they knew it. It was about the flag. It's one thing to avoid seeking representation, but it's another thing altogether to be blatantly misrepresented. That's gotta' hurt. And it will end up hurting all of us that history can be so easily rewritten under the "new rules" of multiculturalism and political correctness. The rewriting of history used to take at least a generation, until the principals involved in the original version were either dead or demented. Now history is rewritten before the ink dries. A little work in Photoshop and a few clicks of the mouse, and it's a done deal. And still, the motives of those who write and those who rewrite may be identical: "Lest we forget."
