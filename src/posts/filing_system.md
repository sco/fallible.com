If I did not, the kids would have walked off with them, and I would have no copies. I also stash my pen-sized containers of pepper spray there. Perhaps my panties feel threatenened, I don't know.... ;)"

    text: "My panties must be pretty bored, too. They just hang out with the bandannas and extra buttons. (Or maybe it's the bandannas and extra buttons that are bored. I won't reveal all my secrets, but let's just say there's nothing too exciting in there.) Maybe I should put in a good book or something suggesting adventure. Do you think my road atlas will do?"

    text: "Road atlas, yes. An excellent beginning to an exciting panty drawer. I just found an envelope addressed to my parents in my panty drawer. (My father's been dead 20 years.) I opened it to find all my report cards from high school, 1972 graduate. I also keep oversized romantic greeting cards my hubby's given me--some are two large to put in the shoe-boxed size containers I put cards in, so the panty drawer is next-in-line......pathetic, but exciting, huh?"

      Lisa, Sorry. ;)  
        
      Madi, Hey, girl! Congrats! Your guy laughs? Most guys I know cannot bear to encounter the word PANTY, but don't hesitate to say lots of truly disgusting words.....I'm sticking with panty!

So I was talking to one of my dearest friends last night, a girl I met when we were just seventeen--and you know what I mean.  
  
We spoke of Doug's mother moving into assisted living, and us beginning the endurance contest of going through the contents of the house she's lived in since 1970, sorting through an accumulation which is sure to include buried treasure, and so must be handled with care.  
  
I had to share with my friend my kid's philosophy about the process we're facing.  
  
"My son has already told me that when we croak, he's pulling a dumpster up and throwing everything out the window. And so I told him, well then. I hope the other two kids get to the gold coins before *you* show up."  
  
My girlfriend, a woman who would enjoy being published some day and with whom I've shared a sensitive and confidential letter correspondence for our whole lives, was aghast, and for good reason.  
  
"But some of my best writing is in your panty drawer!"  
  
Message to my son: When we croak, A.F. has first crack at my panty drawer.
