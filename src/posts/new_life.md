I wasn't eavesdropping, but I couldn't help overhearing snippets of the two young women's conversation in Starbucks.  
  
Here is the essence of what I heard: adultery, verse, every day, chapter, two weeks, God, fear, that's what he does, questions, reason, love, forget, dream, pray, experience, know, remember, scared, worried, sure, hard, it's over, Holy Spirit, let him show you.  
  
And I thought, Yes, that just about says it all.
