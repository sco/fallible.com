"Our sister's a piece of work," says my brother, John. "She was walking ahead of Cyndi and me, and you should have seen her swinging her rear end."  
  
John and Cyndi make a great couple, but John hasn't learned when to keep his mouth shut. I knew what was coming next.  
  
"I mention it to Cyndi, and she says, 'John, you do it, too, when you think someone is watching, when you think you have an audience...'"  
  
I hate to say it, John, but I've noticed.  
  
"You know what else Cyndi says? You know when I swing my rear end the worst? On my way up to receive Holy Communion..."  
  
Playing to an audience, apparently, of more than One.
