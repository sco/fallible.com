The lady in front of me at Kmart was buying 3 containers of grape juice. The sale price was 2 for $1.98, but apparently the computer didn't have the sale price entered, or else couldn't figure out the price for the single. The sales clerk and the lady had a whispered, lengthy discussion. Time passed. A lot of it. The clerk called over to the next clerk for help. The next clerk could not be interrupted, and said so. More time passed. "What's the problem?" I finally asked. "What's $1.98 divided by 2?" the clerk asked, pleading. The lady purchasing the juice looked just as plaintive. "99 cents," I said, and started to say a few words describing how I'd arrived at my conclusion. The clerk thanked me for the answer, but shrugged off the explanation. "I'm just not a *mathetician*," she said. At first I thought I'd heard her wrong, but when she said it once more with feeling, well--let's just say I took her word for it.
