      A hundred daily needs to meet  
      O when I"m yearning to be free"¦  
      Let the children come to me.

Twenty-five years ago, I had three darling little kids. Scott at age seven, Carrie age four, and Kevin only eighteen months old. One day, as serendipity would have it, all of the kids dissolved into a crying and wailing fit at the same time---gathered around and clinging to my legs. In that moment, I didn’t know if I would survive raising children to adulthood. I was so overwhelmed with the enormity of the task that I did the only thing I could. I wrote a poem. If you find yourself surrounded by little ones today, this is for you.

  
              Little children at my feet  
              A hundred daily needs to meet  
              O when I’m yearning to be free...  
              Let the children come to me.

              Places that I’m dreaming of  
              The ocean wide, the sky above  
              But then one climbs upon my knee...  
              Let the children come to me.

              One tugs gently at my skirt  
              A healing kiss for tiny hurt  
              There’s no where I would rather be...  
              Let the children come to me.

              For once a King upon a throne  
              Gave up all that was His own  
              He said with great humility...  
              Let the children come to me.

              So may I bring them one by one  
              To meet the King, Your only Son  
              And in Your kindness, may it be  
              That all my children come to Thee.
