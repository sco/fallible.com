      good dialog is better than action in a story anyway...unless you're writing screenplays for bruce willis or something...

I'm learning a LOT that I will apply to my own dialog-which-is-story writing.<br><br>I still think I could have written Good Will Hunting, or at least the half of the screenplay that started with F. Where's the challenge?"

![Plotless is Seattle](http://www.fallible.com/img/thumbnails/angels.jpg)"Do you want to watch Charlie's Angels tonight?" Doug asks. "I've never seen it, but I think it's an action story without a plot."  
  
"Hmmm," I say, "sounds like something I'm writing, only mine doesn't have action, either."  
  
But the dialog is fantastic.
