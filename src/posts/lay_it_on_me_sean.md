      Every time I hear or see Sean, he reminds me of Dad. Oh, how I wish to hear Dad's voice again....

    text: "So, I googled \"level three communications\" and \"connery\" in order to see if anyone had weighed in on this. See, from the first time I heard that commercial, my belief was that the voiceover is supposed to SOUND like Connery, but that it isn't him. My fiancee disagrees. It just seemed too iconic, i.e. the Scottish/Connery brogue seemed deliberately or artificially accentuated, hyperbolic. Then again, I wouldn't put it past the director of the ad to request Connery himself to exaggerate his own vocal identity (for lack of a better expression--it's more than his accent obviously). Anyway, I'm not convinced it is really him, but am becoming more so. Oh I do so wish I could find out."

![Sean Connery](http://www.fallible.com/sean_connery.jpg)Just saw--actually heard--an ad for a company that's new to me: Level Three Communications. From word one, you knew the voiceover was done by Sean Connery, though his face did not appear.  
  
I'm sitting here grinning, almost weeping. Scottish-born Connery was, as my mother used to say, "laying it on thick."  
  
Guys with brogues are funny that way. My own dad's was beginning to thin in 1976--after being in the U.S. for thirty years--when we made a trip back to his homeland. No sooner did he step foot on the old sod than all heaven broke loose. For five weeks, I followed him around, clueless as to his lyrics but mesmerized with the music.  
  
Dad's been gone almost nineteen years already, but Sean Connery just brought him back.  
  
Or else I've died and gone to brogue heaven.
