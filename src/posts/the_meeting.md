    text: "Man, that's scary... last week my car got stuck in mud in a very deserted, very out-of-the-way place. It was night, no streetlights, and I was alone. I was so scared!! I prayed and prayed and in the end when I floored the accelerator, the car started inching out! I was too frightened to even feel properly relieved or grateful to God for rescuing me..."

Glad you're OK.<br><br>Chris--I'd understand my dreams better if I did watch scary/suspenseful/very intense movies, but I don't. I'm too chicken. One Alfred Hitchcock movie on TV at Grandma's when I was eight, and I was done. I dreamed that movie for the next ten years. I am a voracious dreamer.<br><br>Bridget--Yeah. They'd have a hey-day with me."

Because of where we live, and the nature of our work, and a hundred other factors like our kids and our mothers, we often arrive at destinations separately.  
  
I'd never been there before, but he'd given me precise directions. He'd printed the details from MapQuest and--since I'm a word person--talked me through it. He'd be arriving first, but I could always call him if I needed help.  
  
I can follow directions, thank you. It's road conditions I have a problem with.  
  
The interstate freaked me out a little, but I hung in there with the wet pavement, the orange cones, the eighteen-wheelers, and the migraine.  
  
Soon I'd be on a less-traveled stretch of road, where I could relax a little and enjoy the scenery.  
  
Or so he said.  
  
The idyllic farmhouses, red barns with Coca-Cola signs, flowering trees, and roadside irises never materialized. No one traveling in the opposite direction smiled or raised an index finger from the steering wheel to give me a little wave.  
  
Now that I think about it, there was no opposite direction.  
  
The farther I drove, the steeper and narrower the road became. Somewhere along the way, the lane going south had split from this one, leaving me alone on a desolate road which grew more treacherous by the second.  
  
I could not turn around and make my way back down, not only because the path was too narrow to allow it, but because I'd be going the wrong way on a one way. So I kept climbing higher, edging ever closer to the crumbling brink of the road's narrow ledge. I shook with fear.  
  
"Let's meet there," he'd said.  
  
I thought of his words again as I saw a toll booth just ahead, one he hadn't remembered to warn me about. This was the first person I'd encountered in miles, a welcome sight. But he wouldn't let me pass.  
  
I hadn't counted the cost, and the toll was too high.  
  
Cell phones stop working in those parts. I had no way to reach him, no way to meet him there.  
  
I wondered then how long he'd been waiting for me, how long ago he'd arrived alone and full of anticipation at our meeting place, and if this road had been a good one when he'd traveled it.  
  
I awakened then, and he was still there beside me, in our same old place.  
  
Or was he?
