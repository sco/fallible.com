      I'm still mad because 'unique' is no longer an absolute. When I was in high school you didn't say 'more unique'. It was 'more nearly unique'. I have been informed that 'more unique' is acceptable now and I'm mad about it. How can I correct people in a superior tone now?  
        
      And I'm mad about 'argueably' , too.

Can anyone tell me why, in this day and age in which so few people apparently still believe in *absolutes*, everyone's favorite adverb is *absolutely*?  
  
Just thought I'd ask.
