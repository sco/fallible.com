      I always knew you could find colitis on eBay! Just what I've been searching for... :)

It's one thing for Amazon to have purchasing suggestions for me based on my previous buying habits and expressed interests. Sometimes, they even get it right. But today I spent a little time google searching to learn about a medical condition a friend's been diagnosed with, and the pop-up ads became unbearable. Normally, I don't even see the words before closing down the ads. Somehow this one caught my attention, though: "SaveNow! Recommends--Buy and Sell Ulcerative Colitis on eBay!" So *that's* the cure.
