      Well, I do use an iMac, but I've never set foot in a store. I ordered it over the internet. You don't suppose they have an internet branch of the cult, too, do you?  
        
      I suppose it's called E-cult, and it's all part of the emergent Apple cult....

      Hey, cults are way underrated. If you can get into a grace-filled, Christ-centered cult with no authoritarian baggage, I say go for it!  
        
      I'm <A href="http://atlantasaints.com" rel="nofollow"> part of one </a>...I wouldn't trade my community for anything. : )

      The HUMAN PARADIGM - Intro  
        
      Consider:  
        
      The way we define 'human' determines our view of self,  
        
      others, relationships, institutions, life, and future.  
        
      Important? Only the Creator who made us in His own image  
        
      is qualified to define us accurately. Choose wisely...  
        
      there are results.  
        
      Many problems in human experience are the result of false  
        
      and inaccurate definitions of humankind premised in man-  
        
      made religions and humanistic philosophies.  
        
      Human knowledge is a fraction of the whole universe. The  
        
      balance is a vast void of human ignorance. Human reason  
        
      cannot fully function in such a void, thus, the intellect  
        
      can rise no higher than the criteria by which it perceives  
        
      and measures values.  
        
      Humanism makes man his own standard of measure. However,  
        
      as with all measuring systems, a standard must be greater  
        
      than the value measured. Based on preponderant ignorance  
        
      and an egocentric carnal nature, humanism demotes reason  
        
      to the simpleton task of excuse-making in behalf of the  
        
      rule of appetites, desires, feelings, emotions, and glands.  
        
      Because man, hobbled in an ego-centric predicament, cannot  
        
      invent criteria greater than himself, the humanist lacks  
        
      a predictive capability. Without instinct or transcendent  
        
      criteria, humanism cannot evaluate options with foresight  
        
      and vision for progression and survival. Lacking foresight,  
        
      man is blind to potential consequence and is unwittingly  
        
      committed to mediocrity, averages, and regression - and  
        
      worse. Humanism is an unworthy worship.  
        
      The void of human ignorance can easily be filled with a  
        
      functional faith while not-so-patiently awaiting the foot-  
        
      dragging growth of human knowledge and behavior. Faith,  
        
      initiated by the Creator and revealed and validated in His  
        
      Word, the Bible, brings a transcendent standard to man the  
        
      choice-maker. Other philosophies and religions are man-  
        
      made, humanism, and thereby lack what only the Bible has:  
        
      1.Transcendent Criteria and  
        
      2.Fulfilled Prophetic Validation.  
        
      The vision of faith in God and His Word is survival equip-  
        
      ment for today and the future.  
        
      Man is earth's Choicemaker. Psalm 25:12 He is by nature  
        
      and nature's God a creature of Choice - and of Criteria.  
        
      Psalm 119:30,173 His unique and definitive characteristic  
        
      is, and of Right ought to be, the natural foundation of  
        
      his environments, institutions, and respectful relations  
        
      to his fellow-man. Thus, he is oriented to a Freedom  
        
      whose roots are in the Order of the universe.

      Tim Keel was just relaying to me a conversation that he and Deanne had about the "Mac Cult." His fateful line was as follows...  
        
      "I sure hope that we're bringing as many people to Jesus as we are to Macs."  
        
      LOL!

      Hiya,  
        
      I was recently in the market for a new computer. I was so close to getting a G5 but alas I am timid and the familiarity of a pc was overpowering...So weak am I.

Doug and I are no strangers to borderline-cultish behaviors.  
  
Back in the day (and I'm talking THE day, circa 1970 and following), we were bona fide Jesus Freaks. We were a bit too young (17) to have been full-blown hippies before we became Jesus Freaks, but God fixed all of that. If you weren't a hippie when you joined our rockin' church, you became one in short order.  
  
There were about 1500 kids at the Ministries of Agape in Kansas City, and if you were really committed, you joined with the several hundred who lived "in community" in a certain apartment complex on the south side of town. (This was after the commune called "House of Agape" closed its doors due to all the young people who crashed there eventually pairing off, getting married, and deciding what they really needed was...well, closed doors.)  
  
We couldn't wait to get back from our honeymoon so we could take up residence in our little corner of the community. We found out too late to save our bottom line that another way the group proved its ongoing coolness as well as its astute discernment in collectively hearing the Voice of God was for every household to purchase a Volvo. I happened to have an inheritance from my grandparents, a significant portion of which went to plunk down the cash to make sure we kept up with the Joneses.  
  
Not the Jim Joneses, you nutty people, you. Just the plain old Jesus Freak Joneses.  
  
Were we members of a cult? I don't think so, but lately the old feelings of needing to fit in in order to feel worthy have been creeping back into our lives. We're drinking more Kool-Aid than we used to, and serving it to our friends and family. Frankly, a deja-vu feeling is haunting us, and it all started with the Grand Opening Of The Apple Store On The Plaza In Kansas City.  
  
The opening itself we might have gotten past without being pulled in to the religious fervor of it all, even though the line of espresso-sipping, iPod-listening, scarf-knitting young urban Christians stretched several blocks long. We distinguished ourselves that day, though, among our believing peers, by purchasing not one but two new computers--an iMac G5 for Doug and an iBook G4 for me.  
  
Our son Scott and his new wife Brooke embraced us more passionately and joyfully than they had on their wedding day, welcoming us into the fold. Their pastor, [Tim Keel](http://jacobswellchurch.org/tim/), eyed us with new, well-founded admiration as we whipped out a debit card and laid claim to our status as true Mac-carrying members of the Apple Cult To End All Cults. What a rush!  
  
Since then, we've discovered that the Sabbath--for Mac users blessed enough to live within driving distance of an [Apple Store](http://www.apple.com/retail/countryclubplaza)\--is Saturday. That's the day the faithful make their way, as if on pilgrimage, to the Plaza. Some come bearing faulty iPods, and others wear their plastic bag backpacks filled with return goods. Still others tote large white boxes stamped with grey, bitten apples, reminding us that no matter how perfect the cult, folly still reigns supreme in the world.  
  
Those truly blessed among us are privileged, when our Macs require the attention of a professional at the Apple Genius Bar, to meet with Brandon Edling. Brandon really is one of the best reasons to visit the Store, unless you just enjoy wandering around with other starry-eyed followers, drooling over enormous monitors and darling iPod speakers. Brandon is brilliant, patient, and determined to serve the devoted with good humor and astonishing skill. (Thanks, Brandon!)  
  
If you're hankering for a good, old-fashioned cultish behavior, I can't recommend Macs and the Apple Store highly enough.  
  
I promise, you'll feel just like a kid again.
