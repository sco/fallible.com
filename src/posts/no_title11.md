"I'm alive," I said, because sitting there next to me as plain as day was my brain surgeon, in an audaciously bright holiday sweater, the kind I'm thinking might be banned in heaven. The last time I'd seen him, he was in scrubs and a mask, looking sober. "Was there ever any doubt?" he asked, grinning. Actually, surviving brain surgery has been one of the happiest surprises of my life. Three years to the day later, I'm still celebrating by living on purpose, still thankful for new mercies, and still surprised by a faithful God.
