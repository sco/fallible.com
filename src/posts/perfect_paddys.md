      No good craic, and I did certainly miss being in the classroom this year. It wasn't the same, that's for sure. I had my first official date with Jim 17 years ago today on St. Pat's Day at the Kerry Patch in NKC. He asked me to marry him about 3am that morning. Crazy, huh? Time flies.

Tell me this: Aside from being in Ireland to tread the auld sod today, what's your idea of a great St. Patrick's Day celebration?  
  
To me, unless I've laughed, prayed, sung, and wept, I'm not sure I'm worthy to be counted among the Irish.  
  
So I prayed that everyone in the world might, just for a day, know the blessed feeling of being Irish. Then I listened to some favorite traditional Irish music, featuring whistles and pipes and lyrics written by angels. I sang and wept my way through at least ten times listening to "The Dimmin' of the Day."  
  
And tonight Doug and I will crawl in bed and watch, for the umpteenth wonderful time, my favorite movie in the world, "Waking Ned Devine." I love the characters in this movie like I love my own dear da and all his family. These are my people.  
  
How about you? Did you have some good craic today?
