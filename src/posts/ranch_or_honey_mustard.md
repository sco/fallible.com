      That's funny. It's cute how helpless they can seem sometimes.  
        
      I'm like you. I forget about meals on the weekend, just get busy doing stuff, and the stomach forgets to growl, so I forget to eat.

      I'm kinda having this starvation thingy too. Can I stop over and have you pop some chicken fingers in the oven for me too?

So Kev's gone and it's just the two of us. The weather's nice out there today, and I want to get outside before the temp starts to drop off again, but Doug's been busy with some work for a client.  
  
"I think I've come to a stopping point," he finally announces. It's nearly 3 o'clock. "We could go get some coffee or something."  
  
"Or something?"  
  
"Well, I do have a major starvation problem..."  
  
I never think about this kind of stuff on Saturday. Heck, I barely think about regular meals during the week anymore. We both know where the fridge is, I figure. And the microwave's just a couple steps away. OK. I'm exaggerating about my expanding absence of meal preparation, but not by much.  
  
"I pulled some chicken finger-thingies out of the freezer," I said. "Should I pop them in the oven?"  
  
"Yeah."  
  
"By the way," I asked, "what would you do about your 'major starvation problem' if I were dead?"  
  
"Umm...cook the chicken fingers?"  
  
Next, I'll show him how to pull them out of the freezer. At least then if I croak, he'll be fully prepared.
