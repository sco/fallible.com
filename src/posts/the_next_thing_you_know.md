Cars can be replaced."

---

You're going seventy or seventy-five on the interstate, on the far right, eyeing a suspicious-acting vehicle trying to re-enter the highway from the right side, into your path. You don't quite realize all the traffic in front of you is stopped as the construction up ahead funnels everyone into one lane.  
  
You see those stopped cars a little late in the game, because of watching the car attempting to re-enter the highway, and slam on your brakes. You lay a lot of rubber and there's a burning smell and you skid across three or four lanes to the far left, where there's a small opening waiting for you, if you're lucky. You have no choice, since if you go straight you'll end up under an 18-wheeler, and you're not short enough to survive that maneuver.  
  
The brakes are still screaming when you see another car directly in front of you also heading left for the only opening available, the one you're praying is yours. You realize you're going to hit the car at a horribly high speed and that you're probably going to die.  
  
The *next* thing you see, Kevin says, is a white cloud directly in front of you, and you think you're in heaven. And you're very happy you gave your heart to Jesus when you were a little kid, because now he won't take one look at your pathetic self and say something scriptural like, "Sorry. I never knew you."  
  
And the tow truck hauls your car away, never to be seen again. And the policeman doesn't give you a ticket, because of all the bizarre circumstances, and the construction, and maybe because of your beautiful blue eyes and your sincerity.  
  
And your father comes to bring you home, and he embraces you and kisses you and says, "Don't worry. It's only a car. We're just happy you're alive."  
  
And your mother waits at home, crying and praying and thanking Jesus for providing you with a way of escape.  
And the three of you hold hands and praise the God who inspired mere humans to create air bags--the closest thing to heaven without actually going there.
