      There is something quite charming about a female Christian writer who is not afraid to use the word "fart" in a post - thanks for the much needed chuckle and passing on the advice that I just may have to try for myself!

      From a novice to a master: nice one katy.  
      \*lol\*  
      Thank God Arthur Stace had no pennies, but gave the world all he had too.

My brother John has been running to a local grocery and fixing himself salads for lunch when he doesn't have a sales meeting. Two weeks ago, an elderly patron of the salad bar befriended him.  
  
"Add kidney beans," she advised. "It's the only bean that won't make you fart."  
  
He took her advice and wasn't sorry. A week later, he ran into her again.  
  
"How are you doin'?" he asked.  
  
"Do I know you?"  
  
Did she think he was hitting on her? An old lady can't be too careful these days.  
  
"We met here last week, and you said I should get the kidney beans, and I did," he said.  
  
"You know," she said, as her eyebrows furrowed and she waxed philosophical, "kidney beans won't make you fart."  
  
It is a rare woman--and a determined one--who has gathered unto herself such a miniscule amount of the universe's knowledge, and yet is so willing to share.  
  
During today's lunch hour, he saw her for the third time, and he greeted her in his usual friendly manner.  
  
"I remember you," she said, and he saw something register in the vicinity of her eyes.  
  
"I haven't farted," he responded.  
  
She smiled. "I told you so."  
  
Like the biblical widow who gave her last two pennies in the temple collection, behold a woman who gave everything she had.
