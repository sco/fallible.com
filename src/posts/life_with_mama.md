      Oh, yes, that's our mother.... :)

"Did you try to call my doctor last night?"  
  
Mom sounded a little suspicious, I thought. Too suspicious, in fact, to be ill.  
  
"No," I answered. "What makes you ask?"  
  
"I went for my appointment today. He said my daughter Katy left a message for him last night, and that she asked him what he planned to do about yesterday's bout with low blood sugar."  
  
"It wasn't me," I answered. "Have you *told* someone about your blood sugar? Maybe one of the others called the doc."  
  
I have four siblings, and Mom has a number of nurses in assisted living. Any one of them might have found a compelling reason to call her doctor.  
  
"I haven't told anyone. And I haven't even talked to *you* for quite a few days."  
  
Now accusation was being added to suspicion.  
  
"Then how would I know you had problems with low blood sugar yesterday?"  
  
"I didn't."  
  
"You didn't *what*?"  
  
"Have problems with low blood pressure. Did I say blood pressure? I meant blood sugar. In fact, my blood sugar *and* blood pressure have both been better than ever. But Dr. Barnett kept asking me if I was *sure* I had a daughter named Katy, and I said yes..."  
  
"It wasn't me, Mom, but I'm glad the doctor thinks you're doing great."  
  
"I don't have to go back for three months! Unless, of course, *someone* calls him to report that I'm having problems with low blood sugar..."  
  
You know what they say: If it's not one thing, it's your mother.
