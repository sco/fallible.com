      Those are highly emotional links, Katy. A lot of Celtic blood runs through you.<br><br>I'm finding Ireland a real eye-opener, and I enjoy the stereotypes I've had of the country exploded every day. Not everybody here says 'top of the morning to ye', but they do say 'work away'. I think that's so cool.

    text: "Ivy!! So great to hear from you. I do make it over to your Ireland blog, which I enjoy as much as the Scotland one, for obvious reasons, huh? Of course, I would read them for your excellent writing, even if they weren't set in Scotland and Ireland, my two favorite places on earth. xox<br><br>Lisa, Yes. I've stopped trying to censor the time and place tears happen. It's too stressful. I just kind of let it go these days, and don't worry much about who thinks what. That day, the tears ruled."

There's a major article in the New York Times today about how Scotland's culinary prowess is finally extending beyond haggis and chips. It's about time, I thought. My father is from Scotland, and we were raised to think rutabaga and turnips were the food of the gods.  
  
Strange that reading the Dining Out section made a tear roll down my face.  
  
Next, I came to the story about the life and writing of Leon Uris, who's died at the age of seventy-eight. Just last night, Doug started reading Trinity for the second time. It's a great historical novel about the struggles in Northern Ireland. It helps me understand the life and times of my grandfather, who was raised in the border county of Monaghan, caught unwittingly in the struggle for freedom.  
  
I was weeping now, and didn't care who saw me.  
  
I read the main section last. It contained a disturbing picture of a casket borne through the streets of Belfast on the shoulders of six young men. The deceased was a troublemaker on one side or the other--I'm sure he thought it had been the right side, at least at the time. Behind the men with the casket was a mural painted onto the end of a Belfast building. I have seen the mural with my own eyes, on our first trip to Ireland. The painting portrayed the dead man's father, who was killed for the same cause as the son, exactly twenty years ago.  
  
A second article about Northern Ireland mentioned some new revelations that are just now surfacing about the bombing in Omagh, in 1998. My beautiful Irish friend, Sheryl Heaney, walked by that car-about-to-explode just ten minutes before it killed scores of people.  
  
I thought of Sheryl and her sister Tara dying in a car accident this time last year, and the tears wouldn't stop.  
  
What can I say? These are my people.
