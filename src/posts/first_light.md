"Did you sleep at all?"  
  
"I took a pill," she said. "But I've been awake a long time."  
  
I cried with her very late last night, and again too early this morning. In between, we each lay awake in different cities, in our own beds, with our own husbands, staring at ceilings with eyes wide open, counting the fan blades as they spun darkness into day.  
  
"It must be a hideous mistake," she said.  
  
Her dear friend's son has killed himself.  
  
"All night, as I lay there, I checked their eyes," I said. "I must have examined the eyes of everyone I know--my kids, my husband, my family, even *you*\--looking for, you know..."  
  
"I know."  
  
Looking for the Light.
