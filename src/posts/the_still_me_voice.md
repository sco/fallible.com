      this entry made me laugh and smile, katy. i work in an office with just six other people. sometimes we almost forgot there are others around us. we often find ourselves carrying on conversations with ourselves. it's quite amusing. :)

      i sing LOUDLY in the car, where usually no one is there to endure the noise of it except for Lucy, my four year old, who just thinks it's great that her mom sings and as yet has no concept of things like 'in tune' and 'natural talent'.  
        
      good for the soul...

I talk to myself a lot. And mostly, it's just to hear the sound of my own voice.  
  
I'm not alone all that much. Kevin still lives with us, and Doug and I both work at home. In fact, I concentrate during the day on not interrupting my husband more than necessary, since he's not one of those multi-tasking whizzes who can carry on a lively conversation with me about the presidential campaign or the hurricanes or the terrorists in Russia while simultaneously composing a sales proposal or doing a little back-end programming on a corporate website he's designing.  
  
So, except for a daily foray of energetic commenting on OPBs (Other People's Blogs), I'm a quiet chick. But as soon as the guys leave and the lock turns on the door, it gets pretty noisy around here. I remind myself of Toy Story, where all the teddy bears and dolls and soldiers come alive as soon as the little kids leave the room.  
  
I start singing "I Need You At the Dimmin' Of the Day" (loudly and badly, and with all the flourishes inherent in traditional Irish tunes), acting out parts of musicals ("I feel pretty, oh so pretty...") in front of any mirror I pass, reciting pieces of old political speeches that make me feel alive ("I have nothing to offer you but blood, sweat, and tears...")and behaving more like the Katy of my childhood than I ever do otherwise.  
  
Some people say it's okay to *talk* to yourself, but if you ever start *answering* yourself, watch out. For years, I stopped short of answering myself, carrying on sililoquies with only declarative sentences and rhetorical questions, but I finally gave up the fight.  
  
Now, I have the singular pleasure of being intrigued with both my questions and my answers.  
  
Yeah, you might as well know the truth. I talk to myself a lot. And mostly, it's just to hear the sound of my own voice.
