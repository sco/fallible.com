      Ellen, You've been asked this? I honestly thought it had to be an original!

Overheard in an enormous Barnes and Noble store:  
  
A woman walks up to a salesperson and asks, "Excuse me, where's the non-fiction?"  
  
I kept my elitist, snippy thoughts to myself and I won't divulge them here, but I will say that the bookseller was utterly gracious in her response. Kudos to B&N.
