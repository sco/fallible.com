"Mom, I hate to have to say this, but you forgot to stab me." My 12-year-old son, Scott, was home from the hospital after an 8-day stay for a burst appendix. I had been given the dubious responsibility of "stabbing" his incision to allow it to drain. Without this procedure, which we repeated four times per day for a full week, Scott's incision would have become infected, and he was battling peritonitis as it was. I had no choice but to do it. Each time, I felt like I was killing him. Each time, he felt like I was killing him. Each time, as I remember it, he screamed and I wept. But that night, half a lifetime ago, he knew what had to happen in order for him to recover, in order for both of us to move forward. I still shudder when I think of it, even when it reminds me of the Scripture: "Faithful are the wounds of a friend."
