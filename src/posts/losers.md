"So what's going on in your head?" asks Dr. T, a personal acquaintance of mine these past thirty years. In recent times, I only see him when I require his medical attention, perhaps once a year.  
  
He and his wife lost their son three autumns ago in a car accident. He was eighteen, and beautiful. I am a little self-conscious when inquiring after his family, and he is mildly leery asking about my health.  
  
"Who knows?" I say, only it doesn't quite come out like that since by now he's jabbing around in my mouth with flashlights and pokers. "I've got a couple of weird cysts or something on my gum, one sore tooth, elevated cerebro-spinal fluid, a probable case of TMJ complete with acute facial pain, and....what did you say? I'm deaf in that ear--"  
  
We laugh. We are both at ease now. He knows I'm going to ask, and he's ready.  
  
"Apart from *that*," I say, "I'm fine. But what I want to know is, how are *you*?"  
  
"Apart from *that*, I'm fine."  
  
It is all I ask, and all he needs to say. Spoken or unspoken, *that* will always be there. Making us just fine, apart from it, but never completely able to be apart.  
  
We are well-versed in the language of loss, and have compressed the syllables until they are few and succinct. He smiles a little under his mask, I can tell. His eyes even twinkle the tiniest bit, astonishing me.  
  
Later he tells me a joke while he holds me captive, making a gunky impression of my mouth. He's not a jokester. He is a serious man, always has been, but he makes me laugh till I cry.  
  
I guess we're both losers, in a way. The amazing thing is that neither of us is lost.
