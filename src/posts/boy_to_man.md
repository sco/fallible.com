I'd closed myself into our walk-in pantry for the unlikely purpose of an in-depth cleaning the likes of which the much-used room had never seen. I must have sounded like the mom in Home Alone--only muffled--when she realizes she's left her son behind, bolts upright in the plane, and screams his name.  
  
"*KEVIN*!"  
  
"Mom! Where *are* you?"  
  
If you know high school seniors, you know that few would respond like Kevin did. Some would answer, "Huh?" Others might offer, "What?" A couple might toss back a "*Whatever*..." and leave it at that. Many would pretend not to have heard their mother's frantic plea for help at all.  
  
A very caring or prolific young man might call out, "What do you want?" When you hear his question, you sense he's just buying time, and using the few extra seconds it takes you to shriek, "*Hurry*! It's the biggest, harriest, scariest spider I've ever seen in my *life*!" to formulate his grand excuse.  
  
"But, *Mom*...." he'd whine, "you know I *hate spiders*...."  
  
Kevin *does* hate spiders, but he was running to my side before he even knew what I needed. He didn't waste precious time asking "What?" when he knew the only question that would help me was "Where?"  
  
My youngest child graduates from high school on Saturday. He's still my baby, but now I know for certain that he's the world's grown man.
