      Ouch. That's so painful. And yet so beautiful. Thanks for noticing.

![God's Yellow Ribbon](http://www.fallible.com/img/thumbnails/daffodils.jpg)I hear the news as I'm driving down an oak-lined avenue in town. A Kansas City soldier, husband and father of three, is among the latest POWs.  
  
My eyes scan the historic homes and the elegant trees overhanging the streets, and I wonder when the yellow ribbons will appear.  
  
And then I spot the most majestic oak, encircled at its base with a wreath of newly sprung daffodils.  
  
And I have to ask: Were they there yesterday?
