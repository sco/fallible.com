I'm sitting here in front of the monitor with my elbow on the desk and my chin planted in my fist. It's 6:30 am, and Kev goes back to school today, so I'm up, pretending to be with it.  
  
Doug walks in, muttering.  
  
"I can't find where I put down my cup of coffee..." he groans.  
  
"Yeah, well, I can't take my hand off my arm," I answer.  
  
"You mean your head off your hand," he says.  
  
And a new semester begins.
