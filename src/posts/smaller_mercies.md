      Ahh...Mom...we'll have some stories to share next Monday at the hospital, that's for sure. She was in rare form last weekend when the kids and I were there, too. Each visit is an experience...

The perceived effect of a facial mask treatment can be revitalizing, rejuvenating or refreshing and can serve temporary or long term benefits depending on its usage.<a href=\"www.keratosisremoval.com\">Keratosis</a>"

My mom's kind of losing it, you might have figured out by now. I just spent four hours with her and she said a hundred goofy things, many of them to doctors and nurses, who looked at me like *I* knew what she was talking about.  
  
Some days, it takes all my powers of concentration to untwist what she *says* and accurately explain to another what she *means*.  
  
I filled out reams of paperwork for her upcoming surgery, taking way longer to document her medical history than the operation itself will take. Then two nurses and an anesthesiologist questioned her about what I'd written, as if she had a clue.  
  
"So, you're allergic to penicillin," Nurse Ann said.  
  
"Yes."  
  
"What happens to you?"  
  
"I get bumps all over."  
  
"Ah, hives."  
  
"Yes, hives. But it hasn't happened for a very long time...I don't work out in the yard anymore."  
  
Nurse Ann looked at me for the interpretation, as if my mother had spoken in tongues and I was responsible for making her message clear. I shrugged slightly to indicate my ignorance, but I continued to ponder this in my heart.  
  
Nurse Donna took over for round two. "So, I see here you're allergic to penicillin."  
  
"Yes," my mother said. "And I'm allergic to one other thing, too...(Her voice and facial expression both trail off at this point.) But I don't think it has anything to do with surgery."  
  
"What is it?" Nurse Donna asked, but not without cutting a glance to me first.  
  
"That thing that happens when you go outside."  
  
Now they're both looking at me as if I'm Moses just come down from the mountain.  
  
"*Poison ivy*?" I ask.  
  
"That's *it*." My mother is all smiles now, satisfied that it only took three of us to make one whole woman.  
  
It was a relief to get out of there. I want to help my mother retain the dignity she still has, to allow her to answer her own questions, to not speak up for her prematurely. But it's not always easy, especially when I sense others are impatient with her ramblings.  
  
On the way through the lobby, I spied the widest wheelchair I've ever seen. I pictured wheeling my mother (no petite specimen) out in it after her knee surgery, and ascertained that it just might do the trick.  
  
"Look at that wheelchair, Mom," I said. "That's what I'd call a double-wide."  
  
She examined it in all its glory.  
  
"*So*," she answered, "would that be for, like....*twins*?"  
  
That's all it took to make the day a keeper.
