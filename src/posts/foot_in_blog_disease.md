      Now, if I could just get my mom to understand the concept of a blog... She read this New York Times article (link) and called me up.  
        
      "I read this article about \_blogging\_." (said the word 'blog' as if it were a mouthful to pronounce)  
        
      "Uh-huh."  
        
      "Do you have a \_blog\_?"  
        
      "Yup."  
        
      "So dangerous! Don't write all your personal stuff on the Internet!"  
        
      "Mooooooom..."

But hey,what can you expect from a guy who gives out fake numbers to radio shak when they ask him for his phone number."

      Michael, In going through my archives, I think I almost have enough material here to put together an entire (smallish) book about my mom! She's quite the girl...  
        
      Irene, My mom was OK with the idea after I had my 15 seconds in the Kansas City Star (article about local bloggers). I mean, if you read about it in the paper, it must be legit, right? ;)  
        
      Joshua, I understand your dad completely. I consider myself to be very concerned about privacy issues, and here I am, doing THIS!

I went to see Mom tonight. She told me a nutty story about how right after she had her bunion operated on thirty years ago, she and my dad got on an airplane bound for Las Vegas.  
  
Doctors orders were for her to soak her foot three times a day. Much to my father's chagrin, she hauled a gallon-sized jug of white vinegar onto the plane with her.  
  
"I didn't want to take a chance on getting out there and not being able to get ahold of white vinegar," she said, and then she got a funny look on her face.  
  
"Um...yeah, I can understand that," I said, sympathizing with my poor father, long gone now for twenty years.  
  
"Hey," she said, eyes twinkling, "if you changed the words around a little, that story would make a good blog, wouldn't it?"  
  
Everyone's an entertainer...
