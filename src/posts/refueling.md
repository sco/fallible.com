When several cars are a part of your family's personal property, it can be pretty hard to remember--about any one particular car--whether the gas tank is on the left or the right.  
  
I'm pretty sure the gas tank is on the right on the car Doug and I drive up to Weston, Missouri. Pretty darn sure.  
  
Doug pulls up to the pump as if the tank is on the left. I don't say anything, don't even look at him funny. I just hop out of the car and run in to find the bathroom.  
  
When I come out, it's clear the car is in a different position than when I went in, but there he is, still stretching the hose, still coming up short.  
  
"Did you have to move the car?" I ask, as if I don't know.  
  
"Yeah," he says. "I pulled around to the other side, but it was still wrong."  
  
We laugh till we cry.  
  
Isn't this just like life? When things aren't working out quite right, we imagine we just aren't stretching far enough. When that doesn't work, we pull around to the other side, point ourselves in the opposite direction, thinking if we make a 180, that'll solve everything.  
  
The hose will be longer on the other side, we hope. The fuel will flow smoother. We'll be back on the road in no time.  
  
Then we find out life's just as big a stretch as ever.  
  
So we drive around the station a little bit more, until we remember where the tank is, and how to pull up to the pump. Amazing how the hose stretches with no effort at all, and the journey-granting fluid flows.  
  
And we laugh till we cry.
