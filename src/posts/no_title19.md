Last year at this time, I committed to NaNoWriMo (National Novel Writing Month), during which participants attempt to write 50,000 words toward a novel during the month of November. I actually got down my 50,000 words of, uh, something, so technically I won. Along with several hundred others. I'm in a major funk this year (and I don't just mean this time of year, I mean this whole year!), so I've decided to attempt to write my way out of it by doing NaNo once again. One thing I can attest to is that I have a much better idea of how to novelize than I did last fall, and have a few chapters of a half-way decent story to prove it. No, it's not the story I was beginning last NaNo, but that doesn't matter. What matters is that NaNo got me started. [www.nanowrimo.org](http://www.nanowrimo.org/) remains a terribly unreliable website as of today, but hopefully they'll get it together if you're curious about the progress the many wannabes are making. Some will post excerpts, and others just updated word counts. Last year, I posted excerpts at fallible. We'll see what happens this time. If you want to sign up, it's not too late. Why should I have all the fun?
