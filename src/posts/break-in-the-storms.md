Spindly limbs  
Crackling under weighted, leaden snow  
Like creaking bones,  
Petrified and fracture-ready.

They splinter, one by one,  
Dangling, useless arms  
Swinging in the storm,  
Till separated at the shoulder.

The birds, here by mistaken instinct,  
Hear the trees’ screeching screams  
But pay no mind,  
Free from alarm.

They kiss each falling part,  
Then escape each crashing branch.  
Letting go to save their lives,  
Taking flight to higher sky.
