![bear follows bull](http://www.fallible.com/chalkboard.gif)The ad man was pitching a CD on the local am station called, "How to Prepare for a New Bull Market." It caught my interest enough that I jotted down the 1-800 number.  
  
I scratched out the number when I heard the final lines.  
  
"Although no one knows when a bull market will begin, historically a bull market follows a bear market."  
  
So *that's* how it works.
