      Hmmm... I can't seem to access the comment page because I don't use Blogger. I don't see any article, and the frontpage is blank.  
        
      Is my experience unique, or is everyone seeing this?

      You know the origins of the phrase "pushing the envelope?" It may be that you do, and are just having fun with it. If not...  
        
      I believe it comes from experimental jet pilots, a'la "The Right Stuff." You could only turn so tightly. Too tight, you lost control. The curve which bounded this allow space of movement was "the envelope". Turning or maneuvering too fast and tightly was "pushing it". Sometimes, a pilot would "punch holes in the envelope" and go out of control.  
        
      Like the new look too. But I miss the old one. Went to show your blog to a friend, 'cause I liked the quilting and -- oh, what is this? -- gone forever. Out with the old, in with the new.  
        
      Thank you, Katy.

      I did NOT know about pushing the envelope. My hub doesn't know, either, because I asked him about the phrase before I wrote this. He will love your explanation--and he'll even understand it!  
        
      Maybe Doug can send you the quilt design? I hate for a reader to miss his quilt! Doug, by the way, calls it "knitting."

"Sometimes when you think you are done, it is just the edge of beginning."  
Natalie Goldberg, *Writing Down the Bones*  
Did you ever really understand what people meant when they talked about pushing the envelope? What kind of envelope? Empty and unsealed, filled with unpaid bills, crammed with old love letters from need-to-be-forgotten beaus? Stamped and postmarked? Containing the secreted names of the next Oscar winners? Addressed to me or to someone else?  
  
And to which ultimate destination were we, envelope-pushing novitiates, to push it? Into the mailbox? Into the waiting hands of someone more qualified or prepared to delve into its contents? Into the desk drawer, already stuffed with the envelope pushings of a paper-intensive lifetime?  
  
I can only imagine that the proverbial envelope was meant to be pushed all the way to the edge--and beyond.  
  
But there are edges, and then there are edges.  
  
I wouldn't have any problem pushing the envelope to the edge of the kitchen table, and even over the edge. Watching it flutter to the hardwood floor like a Forrest Gumpian feather wouldn't bother me a bit, since I'm completely able to bend over and pick it up again. I'm still in control, you see--the envelope hasn't exited my field of vision or the reach of my grasp. I still have first right of retrieval.  
  
Nothing can be lost with edge-of-the-table pushing. And nothing gained, either.  
  
There's more risk involved in pushing an overflowing second-day air envelope over the edge of a Fed-Ex box, especially if the envelope contains my latest book proposal and is, after being pushed, irreversibly on its way to an editor or an agent. The possible rejection inherent in that push is one that's caused me to pull back from the edge more than once.  
  
Something can be lost with edge-of-the-mailbox pushing. And something gained, too.  
  
The Bible says that Jesus, through his sacrifice on the cross, cancelled the enormous debt of my sin, which racked up interest minute by minute and accumulated late charges and overdue fees I could never repay. I can picture Him writing "Paid in Full" on the wretched bill, sealing in into an envelope with the King's insignia, and casting it as far away from me as the east is from the west. Over the edge, into a more certain eternity than anything this side of the chasm.  
  
When this life is done, I'll be on the very edge of beginning.  
  
And I'll be thrilled that Jesus knew just where to push the envelope.
