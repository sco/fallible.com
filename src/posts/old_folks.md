Doug and I were almost to the end of the cereal aisle when a mother rounded the corner with her full cart, her young daughter following her.  
  
The mother faced forward and we could see the look of determined grocery shopping in her eyes. She was a get-in-and-get-out kind of woman.  
  
The six-year-old girl, though, hung back, straggled, looking over her shoulder anxiously, watching and waiting.  
  
"Grandma!" the little girl finally said, in a concerned tone. "Come on! Here we are, Grandma!"  
  
How sweet of the child, I thought, to care for the aging woman. The elderly woman's own daughter obviously didn't give a rip. She'd barrelled ahead through the maze of Lucky Charms and Golden Grahams and Count Chocula without so much as a backward glance.  
  
Grandma slowly made the turn then, not in a wheelchair like I expected, and not on crutches, either. She didn't carry a portable oxygen supply, and her arm wasn't in a sling. She didn't even wear wrist braces from playing too many computer games.  
  
The old gal was all of 45 and, if looks tell the story, in the best shape of her life. She was smiling and vibrant in her exercise outfit, and had probably just lagged behind to check out the new *Shape* magazine.  
  
Did the child really think her with-it Grandma had never navigated a Wal-Mart? Or had the young one become cautious by experiencing too much of life's fragility at too young an age?  
  
"You were just like her when you were a little girl," Doug whispered, and it hit me how much I shared the child's feelings.  
  
"I was," I said. And I would have added *And I guess I still am*, but I didn't need to. He understood.
