Will see if I can make a go of it. The list still looms, but admitedly not as awfully as it would if I was going back to work--or school--in a week. Love."

So, after finishing number one in my Psych class of 177, I still haven't figured out whether I'm anal-retentive or passive-aggressive or obsessive-compulsive. I'll let you be the judge. This morning, I compiled my customary after-Christmas, before-New Year's list of every conceivable to-do item I've been neglecting for what seems like the better part of my natural life. The items don't have to be crossed off by New Year's, you understand-it's just that the list must be created this week. I have upwards of forever to complete the tasks. The list itself makes me uneasy, though, before I ever tackle task one. It includes items as mundane as "schedule scan of ovarian cyst" and as brief as "file." The first one should be scarier, but it's not. The list makes me feel alternately heavy, light, burdened, freed, confused and clear headed. Mostly, it makes me feel woefully behind. I came up with 42 things to do in about sixty seconds flat, and then I stopped. I was feeling pretty inadequate as a human being in general, and as a supposedly mature middle-aged woman in particular, when Doug got a look at my list. "Are these in order of importance?" he asked. "Because I think this one needs to be number one." He pointed to where I'd clearly written, "Work on quilt," and read aloud, "Work on guilt." Sigh. If only it was that easy...oh, well, just in case, I'm adding it to my list.
