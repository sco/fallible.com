A kind friend of mine requested that I send her scenes from my novel-in-progress, by email, and so, trepidating, I did. (My husband is the only one who's read any of it, and I was happy enough with that.)  
  
Her response was just like her, generous and effluent.  
  
"Fantastic dialogue, makes me want to know these characters better. A real page-turner, except you have to scroll down..." (A little cyber-humor.)  
  
I guess if I were more secure, I wouldn't immediately have thought, "What if she really means it's a real *scroll-downer*?"  
  
I know. There are medicines that can help with conditions like mine. But first, I'm gonna' email her once more, just to be sure...
