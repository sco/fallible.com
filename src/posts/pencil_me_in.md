      You seem to be a woman with many talents.

I burned my right hand flattening it against a hot iron when I was five, right when I was learning to print. So, I was forced into leftedness. I'm really ambidextrous. But did I spell that right, is the question."

When Winston Churchill's career was going nowhere, before the events of WWII made him a hero, he took up painting. He wanted to have a hobby he could enjoy into his golden years (he was already in his fifties at the time, I believe), and something to take his mind off what he took to be a somewhat failed political life.  
  
His paintings now sell for tens of thousands of dollars, and not just because of his name. He became quite an accomplished artist.  
  
Writing is my primary pursuit, but most of what I'm working on is longer-term stuff, and instant gratification (or even feedback) just doesn't happen at this stage of the game. So, I've been looking for a hobby that could offer nearer-term results.  
  
Spencerian penmanship is one outlet, and I've been using my fountain pens like crazy and with loads of personal satisfaction. Crocheting baby afghans is something to do while watching TV, and there is no one as appreciative of handmade blankies than a baby. I crank out a steady stream of those.  
  
But today, I did something I haven't attempted in 30 years. I did a pencil drawing of my daughter, Carrie. And it turned out *good.*  
  
I know they say if you don't use it, you'll lose it, and of course, they're right. But every once in a while, it's such fun to discover that you didn't use it *or* lose it!  
  
Drawing Carrie was the most fun I've had in a while. I think I'm on to something.
