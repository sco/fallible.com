    text: "Katy, you're not helping the stereotype that many people have of Kansas. <br><br>I mean, shopping cart in a pond? You might as well believe that I go to work in the hospital wearing a short skirt, five inch heels, and a tube top. With the wind perpetually blowing in my hair. ;)"

      Bethany and Lindsey--I fear you know whereof you speak.  
        
      Lisa--Ok. Why did that make me sad? I need help!

    text: "probably the \"little family\" part that did it...though i can't think of a better way to describe it. i had all my kids with me and after the shock and shudders wore off, had to explain the whole thing. so i do not retell that story numbly...but it is still a great hallmark of life out here - the roadkill is impressive (if one is impressed by sheer numbers, that is)"

    text: "Yes, of course. It was the \"little family\"! My former pastor's son almost got killed on his way home from college once, trying not to hit a duckie family! If I remember right, the duckies came out OK on the deal. Did the skunks stink?"

    text: "Maria and others - let's be clear here - the Raymonds live in rural Missouri, \\_not\\_ Kansas. That's just enough closer to Arkansas that the shopping cart makes sense. Now I'm not saying my neighbours with the car lot in their front porch are better, but let's keep the facts straight."

      Lisa, Eeewww!  
        
      Peter, You're absolutely correct. Kansas has no room for shopping carts in ponds. They're too busy hosting the world's largest ball of twine.

    text: "...and we're very proud of that twine (ok, i'm not a native kansan and have never actually SEEN the thing, but from what I know about the work ethic in these here farm communities, I'm sure it's a beaut :)"

We don't own a rain gauge, but let's just say we've had about a gazillion inches of the stuff in the last 48 hours, officially ending a horrible drought.  
  
"The neighbor's pond's looking *better*," eighteen-year-old Kevin says. "Can't even see the shopping cart."  
  
That's life in the boonies.
