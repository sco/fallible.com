As a result of three encouraging meetings with editors (and a fourth with an agent) at the writer's conference mentioned below, I am completing a full-blown proposal for a contemporary women's novel! For those of you who read excerpts from what I wrote during National Novel Writing Month last November, don't cry for me! This is a different story all together. Can't quite say how excited I am to be attempting this "for real." I covet your prayers!
