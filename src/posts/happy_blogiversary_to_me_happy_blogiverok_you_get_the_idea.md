      Very elegant.  
      It must be a guy thing because I agree with Kevin.  
      I like the homey feel of the red. Plus the red makes you look younger.  
        
      Either way I'll read and enjoy your works.  
      I hope I didn't offend.  
        
      Take Care

      I'm really getting a kick out of the diff between the men's and ladies' comments! I figured this would happen... :)  
        
      I liked the red a lot, too. It was my idea to do the quilt-block thing 4 years ago, with the one upside down "basket" to show the idea of "fallible." Did you guys even notice the "mistake" in the design?  
        
      As for this design making me look "older," what can I say? I could post a current pic of myself, and that would end the matter in a graphic way! Or I could keep attempting to approximate some semblance of youth through my sparkling use of language. Tee, hee!  
        
      I love all the comments, in either direction! Thanks.

      Geez...we just got around to putting up pictures on our walls and we've lived in the house for ten years....I like the new look...liked the old look...primarily I like the content.  
        
      Er...unless of course Doug needs some type of validation or something, in which case..bravo! Well done! What a guy!

In honor of my 4-year-blogiversary, which happens in December, I am the happy recipient of a new look! Well, not I, exactly. But fallible. Not that I couldn't use a new look, but that is outside the scope of this discussion. Please.  
  
Many thanks to my techie husband, Doug, for devoting the better part of his Thanksgiving weekend to all kinds of stuff I don't pretend or even aspire to understand. He's brilliant and handsome, and has never himself, in my opinion, wanted for a new look. Unlike me.  
  
If you enjoy the functionality, thank him. If you like the look, we're both responsible. Mostly me. But still. All my design ideas are pretty useless without someone who can make them happen.  
  
I'll end by saying that Doug and I will soon be entering into a little experiment here in the blogosphere, one that might be entertaining, enlightening, and maddening. In which order, I can't possibly predict.  
  
But I do hope you'll enjoy it!
