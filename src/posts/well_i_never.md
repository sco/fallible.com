      i can't imagine standing in suzy's shoes. on another note..i never go back either. i'm blazing a trail to have my hair done by every stylist in the tri county area....or something. just last week i went somewhere new - as a walk in no less! and got a cute little flippy cut dyed near black. all i'd said was "i'm done with these highlights". cute...but i'm already thinking of where else i'll try next time..

      Hi,  
      Hatha Yoga has been widely researched, studied and proven to show results in treating depression. The benefits of practicing Hatha yoga far outweigh any other forms of alternative therapy in treating depression. Pranayama in itself is solely responsible for helping to normalize the mind and body connection and through its persuasive breathing techniques and meditative practices you will be able to reduce the stress anxiety and get rid of all forms of negative feelings.

I'm the kind of woman who never gets her hair done by the same stylist twice.  
  
Even if I'm perfectly happy with Rita or Richard or Rose, by the time I'm ready to go again, I settle for pot-luck. Until recently, that is.  
  
In July I decided to get a perm to look gorgeous for my son's wedding (the first one in six years--perm, not wedding) and, since I knew no stylist well enough to go back for seconds, I ended up as a walk-in with Suzy.  
  
Let's just say Suzy and I bonded. We're about the same age, both married with grown kids, and each of us in full possession of most of our wits and an outstanding sense of humor.  
  
Suzy has not one, but two sons serving with the armed forces in Fallujah. I never know when I go in whether she'll be laughing or crying, talkative or pensive. Either way, we're on the same wave length. So to speak.  
  
That's why it was so hard for me to hear the news she had to tell me the other day. She wasn't quite herself, I'd noticed, but I didn't want to pry. She seemed troubled, like she had when I went to see her in September and she was stressing about her son who's battling depression.  
  
I figured if she wanted to share, she would. I was right.  
  
As she took the rods out of my hair and put it through its final rinse, she said, "This perm is going to work well for you. The curls really help cover the gray."  
  
Gray? What gray?  
  
Just then, someone in the shop turned up the radio and Suzy and I began to sing the chorus in unison, with feeling. I think we both knew what was happening.  
  
"Didn't we almost have it all, my friend..."  
  
Some relationships just aren't meant to be permanent.
