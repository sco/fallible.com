      i was driving from lawrence to topeka yesterday late afternoon in the midst of all the severe weather reports and warnings...the explosions of white clouds, general electricity in the air, and my extreme tiredness after not much sleep the night before made for a rather surreal trip. i did think of you, katy, and hoped you and yours were not in the path of that storm!

![Your house is not in Kansas any more.](http://www.fallible.com/img/thumbnails/tornado.jpg)Not all the news is bad in Kansas City tonight, though they're already saying these are the worst tornados here since the ones in the late 1950s.  
  
One man followed tornado precautions to a tee. He went alone to the basement of his home in Wyandotte County, never imagining--if he's like most guys in the basement--that he wouldn't be able to climb back up without help.  
  
His home blew away. His neighbors came checking, and they pulled him from the debris without a single scratch.  
  
"Those were the sweetest voices I've ever heard," he said.  
  
Beauty from ashes.
