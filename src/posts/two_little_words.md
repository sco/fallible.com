      Amber, You are my kind of woman!  
      I'm headed out to my monthly writers group, where I'm going to pull out a big honking three-ring binder (printed-out book) and do the happy dance. They'll understand... ;)

      You guys are so great! I mailed the disk on Jan. 14--SO MUCH FUN! I'm about to begin the sequel, with the attitude "Write the next book as if you've won the contest!" (Trying to change the negative self-talk of a lifetime. Whether I can change it or not, I will forge ahead.....)  
        
      Kelly--The main character in my book is Kelly!

I've always had a problem deciding which *three little words* are my favorite. Conventional wisdom would point a hopeless romantic in the direction of "I love you," of course. But what about the other three, "Let's eat out"?  
  
If I never choose, I'm okay with that, because now I know what my favorite *two little words* are: "The End."  
  
I've never in my entire life had more fun than when I just typed those words at the bottom of my manuscript. Getting the story published will be a blast, if it happens. But in my book, "The End" might end up being the biggest thrill of all.
