      Tina--We did NOT like it. Wimbledon. The ending was fairly strong, but you had to watch a lot of weak stuff to get there...  
        
      Doug was only kidding about the date of the review. He's funny that way. :)

Doug's rifling through DVDs in our bedroom, and comes up with one we haven't seen.  
  
"Do you want to watch it? The reviewer says it's one of the best romantic comedies of the year..."  
  
"OK," I say. "I'm in."  
  
"Of course," he deadpans, "the review was written on January 1."
