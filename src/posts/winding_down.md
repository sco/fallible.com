      First off, happy New Year. :)<br><br>I am like you, in that I like to start the new year "fresh" and have everything in a better order than it was the previous year. My resolutions always tend to be a bit vague (e.g. "have more patience"), so I kind of view it as continuing on the path.<br><br>Who knows how fast I am actually progressing. ;)

I've been thinking about the processes I go through in winding down a year, beyond the making of resolutions, which I don't do. My processes serve somewhat as resolutions might, I guess, since they set me up for a fresh start in a number of areas of my life.  
  
I make sure all the clothing and household items I've collected to be donated are actually given away this week. I transfer all the dates for 2003 that I've been saving to put on a new calendar, which Kevin gave me for my birthday yesterday. I delete tons of useless "favorites" and otherwise attempt to reorganize my computer files. (I am not good at this.)  
  
I make sure the finances are in great order, both the personal and the business, and that any tax issues that must be addressed before year's end, are. I catch up with paper filing. I clean out the refrigerator. I break out a fresh journal and a new Bible-reading schedule. I clean all my jewelry.  
  
And then, right before we go out to ring the new in, I take a luxurious nap.  
  
What do you do to close out the year? Are you a resolution maker, or not? If you are, are you a resolution keeper? How does that work? I'd love to hear from you.
