Revolving doors give me a thrill like other people might get on a high-voltage ride at Worlds of Fun. It's nice to enter one when no one else is around, and use my own steam, lightly applied, to gain access to the building of my choice. I refuse to hop in an already moving door, though, to fill a slot in an apparatus under the control of an unknown person clearly intent on going the opposite direction from mine. Why should I submit to his pace, his intensity or lack therof, his control over my circumstances? When I do, I inevitably emerge on the other side breathless, and more than a little stunned at the sudden lurching stop the ride has come to. Sometimes, my life is a revolving door, with one space filled by Someone whose eyes meet mine for just a second as He heads the other way. Sometimes, when I see those eyes, I ride the door all the way around and follow Him wherever He goes.
