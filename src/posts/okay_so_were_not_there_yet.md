      Don't worry... "Doug & Katy" has that same off-the-tongue ring that "Brock & Brodie" does -- if not the alliteration. I think you should stick with it. :)

      Thanks, you guys. Your encouragement to just "be ourselves" means a lot!  
        
      Rocky--How are you, son? So nice of you to pop in here! How's your children's book coming?

Why Doug and I have taken so completely to collaborating on some writing projects, when we've never attempted anything like this before, I can't exactly say.  
  
But I will say that recently, we've been reminding me of my favorite husband and wife author team, Brock and Bodie Thoene. We've cooperated on a number of blog subjects by writing companion pieces, and suddenly I'm entertaining illusions of publishing grandeur.  
  
Soon, surely, we'll be co-authoring historical novels, with Doug doing all the award-winning research like Brock, and me introducing the fictional elements and assembling the story line, just like Bodie. We'll edit each other's work without taking it personally, not feel threatened by the other's achievements, and grow closer--emotionally and spiritually--with every passing day.  
  
"Hey, baby," I say, when he comes up with his eighth or ninth brilliant idea today, "I'm gonna' start calling you Brock."  
  
He shoots me a look.  
  
"And you can call me Bodie," I add with a grin.  
  
"Can I call you Body?" he asks.  
  
On second thought, we'd better just stick with Doug and Katy.
