      I'd be busting up laughing at that right now, but it's 3:44am and I don't want to wake up my sleeping family.

I saw the stringy-haired blonde asking a clerk a question in aisle four of Walgreen's. Thirty seconds later we met personally in aisle three, where I was looking at small appliances and she at a display of electrial power strips and extension cords. "Have you seen the glue?" she asked. I looked around. She was talking to me. "I don't think it would be here," I answered. Just then she reached up and grabbed two tubes of Super Glue. "Have you seen the fake fingernails?" she asked. I became frightened. Today, in the historic Waldo neighborhood of Kansas City, Missouri, some poor woman has received her final manicure.
