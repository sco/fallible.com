Becoming too attached to something (in this case, earrings) can be dangerous.<br><br>Ultimately, we can only do the best we can and leave the rest to God. After all, even though you might put lots of care into your earrings, you might actually lose the earring that you thought you had so securely attached to your GOOD ear."

The doctors misdiagnosed the kind she was having, and by the time she was diagnosed properly (by different doctors) she had endured brain damage. She's 25 years old now and still medicated, but you can tell she's a sharp cookie underneath the fuzz of damage and medication. She can read, write, and she lives semi-independently in a Christian group home and holds down a job."

    text: "Ellen, Your sister sounds like she's done really well. It's great she can live in a group home, and work and all. I asked about your mom because I had an acoustic tumor (on the hearing nerve, deep in skull) which took my hearing in one fell swoop. I've met several people who've had these, so I just wondered...."

![Stud on me...](http://www.fallible.com/img/diamondstuds.jpg)*I can't hear a thing*, I think.  
  
I'm struggling to put an earring in my right ear, using one hand to insert the diamond studded post, and the other to screw on the back. I can't remember which direction to screw the back, so I'm fumbling first clockwise and then counter-clockwise.  
  
To a hearing ear, direction is automatic. An operating ear discerns an efficient turn of the screw without the wearer of the jewels even realizing it. She doesn't need to stare into the mirror, paranoid of losing her treasure, or frantically rub her thumb and index finger along the post to see if the screwback really is moving in her favor. Her valuables are safeguarded and secured.  
  
I do the deaf side first, leary, fumbling through it, eyeglasses on, fixated on the mirror. Several attempts before a shaky success.  
  
The left earring goes in, and I begin to screw the back the wrong way. I'm instantly, imperceptibly aware that this ear's perfect hearing is not registering the metallic twisting into the tiny groove, so I immediately alter my course.  
  
*Ah, that's it*, I think. *My diamond will soon be safe.*  
  
I can't help wondering about the living, breathing jewels I love and care about. What if I don't really *hear* them half the time? Do I shrug off their priceless value and risk losing them, or do I mobilize all my remaining senses to compensate for my glaring deficit?  
  
As I turn away from the mirror's reflection of my gleaming jewels, I raise both hands to my ears, running my thumbs in the grooves of the backs to make sure they're equally secured. One diamond is silent, and the other divulges all.  
  
Both are my treasures.
