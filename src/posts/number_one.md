      In case you're wondering, I offered the fellow over at marginal.com the opportunity to write a companion post to this one, but he declined. :)

      Lydia--See? This is why I'm no good at jobs in the "real world." I've been called on the carpet by the "big boss" before, because of suspicions about what I must be doing during all those disappearances to the john. When you gotta go, you gotta!  
        
      Lisa--I'm convinced there is an inherited gene for potty humor. I got mine from my mother, who persists with hers to this day. Doug says the first time he met her, the discussion turned...toward that end. My brother also got the gene, but I believe that my three sisters are free of it. (Correct me, Bridget, if I'm wrong!)  
        
      My dear husband was not raised by wolves. (Yawn...) There's not a potty humorist among them. He has come to embrace my stories, though, knowing that they are largely non-fiction, and being the sympathetic sort.  
        
      Still, if my regaling gets to be more than he can bear alone, he puts and end to it by saying, "Uh, Katy...that's a blog."  
        
      And so I turn to you.

      The inclination toward potty jokes runs deep in the McKenna clan, and there's been no movement away from that. I just won't go there.  
        
      BTW, Katy meant to write marginalcomments.com above. Katy and I may occassionally sound like we're from different planets, but apparently the guy from marginal.com really \*is\* from another planet.

      I forgot to add that our two sons take after their father, but our daughter Carrie--otherwise as couth as the next girl--may yet prove to be even more afflicted by the potty humor gene than I.  
        
      She says it comes from "seeing everything" while working in a hospital, but I don't think so. I've worked for a yarn store, an insurance agent, and for the publisher of "Pork" magazine. I've been largely surrounded by people who won't admit to having bladders at all, much less small ones.  
        
      You've either got the gene or you don't...

    text: "..and then again, if you didn't possess the potty gene before you lived with infants and toddlers, you most likely will after the experience..from the thousand diapers you change a day to the maddening season of POTTY TRAINING. i can say from experience that no bodily function can really shock a mother of preschoolers..."

    text: "OMG, you bring back memories of road trips when we were first married, with six packs of Pepsi, but it was me, not my wife singing the \"gotta go\" song. I once jumped out of the car to run to the gas station. These days its the blood pressure medication that causes that problem, but then again, there are more gas stations with restrooms now too."

Have you seen the horrifying ads in which two young women (I'm talkin' my age!) are driving down the highway, hair flying in the breeze, on the Thelma-and-Louise-style road trip of a lifetime? And how they've made Depends undergarments part of their regular "travel gear"?  
  
Did I mention they're MY AGE?  
  
I groan every time I watch those chicks zip their pants up over their supposedly sleek adult diapers, and wonder how long it will be before a huge honkin' package of Depends is part of my travel gear, too.  
  
Today, I was trucking down the road at a pretty good clip, realizing I still had quite a few minutes left until I'd be arriving at my destination. I started humming that song for the anti-pee drug: "Gotta go, gotta go, gotta go right now..."  
  
It's hard to cross your legs while driving, but somehow I managed. Until, that is, a huge flatbed filled with at least two dozen porta-potties merged onto the highway right in front of me.  
  
I followed those toities all the way to my exit. I wish I could describe the measure of comfort I found just knowing that, in case of emergency, they were there.  
  
I may be getting old, but at least I'm still living life at the speed of Johnny-On-The-Spots!
