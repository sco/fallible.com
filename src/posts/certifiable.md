You know how they say that it's not so bad to talk to yourself, but when you start answering yourself, watch out?  
  
It doesn't help that I've been alone for most of 48 hours, with only the voices of novel characters to keep me company. But still.  
  
Just now, as I was coming to the end of a three-minute long stretch of procrastination and about to get back to my writing, I heard myself say these words out loud:  
  
(Spoken in a snotty voice) "So, are you gonna' get back to it?"  
  
(In an even snottier voice) "I don't know. Are you?"  
  
So, it's official.
