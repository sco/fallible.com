      I've never commented, but I just want to say I love reading your blog. Also, if you're really that bored, you can check out mine (sporadically updated though it is) at bcampbell.blogspot.com

    text: "Peter, You are kind. I've checked your sites a couple of times today. Kim needs to start a blog so I can get both sides of the story! It's noon now, and I've added 1200 words to my novel between blog-reading-avoidance behaviors, so that 's not too pathetic. 800 more words, and I can stop being afraid until tomorrow!"

    text: "I was just going to tell you I do the same thing with your blog, petes and sco's each time I sit down to work. I am a bit of a procrastinator and your blog always provides a great distraction and a rational to my procrastionation. I laughed when I saw Peter had already commented in the same manner and then you saw that you addressed me-- I will try to summon the courage to start a blog if it would help you out. :)"

    text: "Lisa, Great quote! I'm looking ahead at my calendar for October and realizing I have no idea in heaven how I'm going to fit my writing schedule in! I feel like I've failed 10,000 times at figuring out how to have a productive writing life.(Reading blogs is only a little diversion. Real life provides the rest.)"

    text: "ah, yes...real life. i find it hard to make room for a creative outlet in the midst of family needs, laundry, cooking, barista-ing, etcetera. it's important, though, so let us keep plugging away at those snatches of time, those scheduled hours, giving up a bit of sleep here, a clean living room there. life can't become so engrossing we have no time left to try to recapture pieces of it in story, song or color, eh?"

    text: "You are a right-thinking woman. Hanging on to your great perspective will serve you well throughout your lifetime! Perhaps I postponed creative outlets too aggressively while the kids were young. Now that I've got the time, I'm not sure the needed brain connections have been established. Practice your creativity, girl!!"

      Lisa, Baby steps! Keeping the mind engaged, the heart active, the soul alive. You're doing great.  
        
      Ellen, Very much enjoy the new look at your site! And that you list fallible under "writers" gave me a bit of a thrill, I might add. Thanks!

So. It's 8:15 a.m. I've been up two hours already. Kev left for school an hour ago, and Doug is gone to all-day meetings. I'm alone in the house, which rarely happens in a two-career-self-employed-couple.  
  
I've visited every blog in my favorites, including those who only post once every eleven months . Now I'm on my second go-round through all the sites I look at every day, just in case I missed something. All in an effort to avoid opening a Word doc and beginning a good day's work on my novel.  
  
Question: When will I stop being such a chicken, and just face the fact that I don't have a clue what will happen with my book until I start to write today's words?  
  
Second question: Will a whole bunch of you please blog RIGHT NOW? You have no idea how much this means to me.
