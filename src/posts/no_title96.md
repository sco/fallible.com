"Some people decide to follow the devil," said my five-year-old niece, Logan, as we sat at her kitchen table, coloring. "But we've decided to follow Jesus." "Yes, and someday we'll go be with Him forever in Heaven," I said. "I wonder what it will be like there?" She picked up her purple crayon to apply some broad strokes inside Barney's rotund lines. Her eyes gleamed. "It's going to be the world's biggest Chucky Cheese!" she said. And with her there, it's going to be a blast!
