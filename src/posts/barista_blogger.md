I have a young friend whose blog I read. She is a woman of few (just so you know I'm not speaking of myself!) but meaningful words. She is frustrated when the words won't come at a pace to satisfy her voracious readers.  
  
I hope her readers are willing to wait, though, willing to give her the time she needs to formulate her thoughts into a sequence of words which will be something she really wants to give. If she does less than that, they will be unhappy, and will likely lose their eager anticipation of her next offering.  
  
It all reminds me of my addiction to Starbuck's. I want it daily, every day, once per day, without fail, sometimes so badly that when I arrive there, breathless, I add to my instructions, "Hurry! I just can't wait any longer!"  
  
But if I indicate my desperation, the barista might inadvertantly short-venti me in her desire to please quickly, and then where would I be?  
  
Adding cold milk on top of hot froth, that's where.  
  
And so, instead, I sweet-talk her, encourage her to relax and take her time, hoping she's not worried about the line of customers accumulating behind me, wanting theirs.  
  
I might wait a bit longer, but I'm rarely disappointed.
