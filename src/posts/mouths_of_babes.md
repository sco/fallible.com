I thought to myself, \"That's really cool.\"<br><br>Then I went to your site and read backward, all the way to the beginning. Yes, fallible.com is one of my favorite blogs out there. As soon as I get my blogroll up and going, it will be on there.<br><br>Thanks, Mrs. Raymond, for the beautiful site."
