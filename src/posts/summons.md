The stock market is down 3000 pts since the new President was inaugurated, and GW did abandon the free market principles with the first bailout. How this country can avoid bankruptcy and complete collapse with all this spending is beyond me. I fear the worst, yet pray for the mercy of God on us. Now is the time for \"If my people...\""

Family, friends, etc. unless you have a proven track record. It would be in your best interest to have a business plan including exit strategy and time lines. The more time you spend on this phase, the more likely you are to convince people that you will succeed and thus their money is safe."

      Hi,  
      I am writing a paper and I need to know how the printing press caused the reformation, and how it lead to political, social, and economical changes. If you know any articles websites or books about this please let me know. Also any facts about the subject would be much appreciated.

Yesterday, I read that Blogger and Twitter founder Evan Williams, a young man I actually corresponded with by email seven or so years ago about a business idea my husband and I had, was [summoned to the White House](http://www.zmogo.com/tag/evan-williams/) in order to offer his advice about the abysmal economic crisis in which we now find ourselves.

I hadn’t yet signed up to follow Ev on Twitter, but I did so, post haste. He gave a number of updates throughout his day at the White House, and also posted a picture of himself standing next to Ivanka Trump, with the House in the background. He didn’t say so in so many words, but it seemed clear enough that Ivanka had also been invited to share her brilliance with our current administration.

Then, this morning, I come upon [this story](http://www.breitbart.com/article.php?id=D96ONQO00&show_article=1), which manages to encompass EVERY cause of our current debacle (irresponsible lending, greed, belief that markets can only go up, spending your own children’s future, believing that spending should come before or instead of earning, trusting in complimentary sirloin-tip buffet soirees to assure you that you’ve made sound economic decisions, and all the rest of it) in a few easy-to-read but difficult-to-digest words. Ivanka, evidently, was hugely a part of this failed undertaking of the Trumps, which only recently occurred, and has now been rewarded by being treated as if she’s all that and a bag of Perrier.

Is THIS what the leaders of our country need? To be counseled by the (admittedly brilliant) guy who runs Twitter, who asks his 200,000 followers “What should I say?” before leaving to share his answers with the administration? Does the United States of America now NEED the advice of Ivanka Trump, a young woman who told investors in a Baja resort that a Trump property COULD NOT FAIL?

We’re falling far and fast here, people. Our problems are way too serious to be rearranging deck chairs on the Titanic. We don’t need another summit every fool day on the economy, health care, education, and shovel readiness. And trust me, I am NOT saying Obama is responsible for this mess. As much as I admired some things about George Bush, I lost my remaining respect for him the day he said, last fall, “I am abandoning my free market principles to save the free market.”

Sorry, O fallible ones. It just doesn’t work that way. A principle is something you hold so dear and so constant that it eventually becomes the ONLY thing you can’t and won’t abandon. Otherwise, it is no principle at all, but only another half-thought-out weakly formed opinion.

I am aligning myself with some age-old economic principles, ones I have never taken the time to understand, study, or devote myself to---until now. I’ve realized that I can no longer entertain the luxury of believing that printing presses should invent new money ‘round the clock. Or that the Federal Reserve should intervene in the free market by manipulating interest rates, thereby keeping the boom and bust cycle artificially exacerbated.

In fact, here’s what I really think, and it happens to agree completely with what my banker father believed until his death 25 years ago: There should be NO central bank in the United States of America. The Federal Reserve system should be abolished, and the free markets should be allowed free rein. In addition, we should rue the day that Richard Nixon, in 1971, completely disconnected our economy from the gold standard once and for all, and should do everything in our power to move toward a financial system that is NOT based on fractional reserve banking but that is based rather on a REAL MONEY economy.

If I had understood half of what Ron Paul was saying one short year ago, I would have given far more money to his campaign than I did and I would have fought far harder to see him and his ideas promoted. Interesting that we now have an unfolding crisis in which all Paul preaches is coming home to roost. In my opinion, he remains the only presidential candidate that could have helped us navigate these waters, but alas, it wasn’t to be.

Instead, we move the chairs around on the deck just so, tap our feet to the beat of the orchestra, and imagine that the giant iceberg that’s already ripped away half the hull is just another sign of global warming.
