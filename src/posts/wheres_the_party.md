John Kerry's daughters, Alexandra and Vanessa, have just finished introducing their father to the Democratic conventioneers and Doug has disappeared from the room.  
  
Surely he's coming back, I think, and I wait almost until the several-minute-long campaign film is done running before I go hunting for him.  
  
I find him in the kitchen, standing in front of the other TV, engrossed.  
  
"Watching him in here?" I ask, proud of us for being a two-television history-in-the-making family.  
  
"Yeah," he says, but then I look a little closer at the screen.  
  
"What *is* this?" I ask.  
  
He doesn't blink. "*Last Comic Standing*."  
  
Well, then.
