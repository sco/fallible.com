Only a few can stand Alone Like an island carved in stone. Most of them need gracious friends To smooth the edges, round the ends. In sentences, they take the chance Of overstating happenstance, And paragraphs do seldom seem To aptly state a simple dream. But still, a solitary word, at best, Just stands Aloof From all the rest.
