      chad and i were talking last night about how "with much knowledge comes much grief". it's nice to block it out sometimes and focus on something not so heavy as the day to day grind, the things that cause forehead wrinkles and worry lines...good for you, stopping to smell the roses and ignore the thorns.

      Nice post. I did the same thing last night, waking up at 2:30 and then again early this morning to watch the news. Such devastation.  
        
      My husband and I celebrate our 29th anniversary Monday. I might try to find our wedding photo and set it out. It'd be good for a few laughs. \*g\*

      Lisa--I'm afraid my poor face has gone past "lined"--straight to "engraved"! Ah, well, I suppose I can't be mistaken for someone who doesn't care! Part of caring, of course, has to be making sure I pay attention to that guy on the dresser over there, the greatest guy in all the world...  
        
      Donna--Bring out your wedding pic, and Happy Anniversary! I've always had one 8x10 pic in our bedroom, but then I've also got my parents' 1950 wedding portrait in there, and Doug's Aunt Jean (Paris in the 1920s), too....I'm not sure what that says about us.

In one corner of our bedroom stands a cabinet holding a TV, DVD player, and a gazillion movies. On the other side of the room, on my favorite Eastlake Victorian antique dresser, rests an almost 28-year-old wedding portrait of Doug and me in a beautiful gilded frame.  
  
And here I am, caught in the middle with you.  
  
To my left, Fox News is showing continuous footage of Hurricane Ivan, interspersed with coverage of the war in Iraq and even a tiny bit of what we may come to remember as "Rathergate."  
  
I have the volume muted. I've heard it all before. Heck, I even woke up around 3 am and checked on the hurricane's progress, prayed for the people in its path. But even without volume, the fast-moving pictures hover there, on the left side of consciousness, causing me to be hyper-aware of current events and the weight they are on our lives.  
  
I don't know what made me turn to the right just now. I don't know why my eyes fell on the young couple, the man seated like a prince, the girl standing beside and somewhat behind him, her fragile hand on his shoulder. (We did "fake submission" so well back then!)  
  
All I know is that their heads are completely obliterated by a flashing, furtive superimposition of world events. The fading colors of the couple from the shoulders down seem barely able to support the riotous winds and floods of life. It almost looks as if her knees are buckling under her gown, and I swear he's white-knuckling the oak arms of his chair.  
  
I'll get up in a minute and turn off the TV. I won't forget about the world and its concerns, but I need to see the young couple's shining faces again.  
  
To read their eyes, to memorize their smiles, to remember the incredible lightness.
