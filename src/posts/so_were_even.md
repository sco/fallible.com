Sometimes, Dave Barry is the only man on earth who can clear matters up for me. Yesterday's column about females and their rear ends served just such a purpose.  
  
Don't get me wrong. I understand the whole rear end thing. [Dave's column](http://www.miami.com/mld/miamiherald/living/columnists/dave_barry/6439124.htm) provided the answer to a related question that has disturbed me for years, and he didn't even refer to my actual question once.  
  
We've all read the studies on how often men think about sex. I've asked around, and the sheepish looks on the faces of the males I've queried has supported the results of the studies.  
  
My question has always been, "So how do men actually get anything *done*? How are they able to be productive members of the work force, upstanding citizens, good husbands and fathers and neighbors, with all those distracting *thoughts* hitting their little minds at the rate of one every five seconds? *How*?"  
  
As it turns out, men have oodles of spare thought time in spite of their pesky predilections. Dave Barry says that *decades* go by without the average male giving a *single thought* to the size of his own rear end.  
  
Ladies, I ask you. Can you imagine what we could accomplish with all the time those guys have on their hands?
