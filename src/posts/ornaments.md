      oooh...i could've watched that for a good hour, too. kansas at age 1 or so had a window that was bigger than our tv and perfect elbow leaning height to watch squirrels chase each other and birds fly from branch to nest to ground, et cetera...he would be entertained for good long periods at that window...priceless, absolutely priceless.

      Kansas reminds me of 5-year-old Kevin. We were sitting at the kitchen table, and I was insisting he work on his letters in a workbook. He was abyssmally unhappy. Finally, he perked up and said, "Wait! That bird is singing my favorite song..."  
      He couldn't say his r's, so bird came out so darned adorable, I've never forgotten it.

A pleasingly plump evergreen sits just outside my bedroom window. It's beginning to look a little like Christmas, the sky holding at least the promise of snow, if not the reality.  
  
The bare tree reminds me of my total lack of preparation for the season. No decorations yet, very few gifts purchased, no party invitations either given or received.  
  
I'd almost decided to plunk down $38.88 at Wal-Mart for a tabletop fiber-optic shrub and call it Christmas.  
  
Then the birds arrived. Not just any old brown birds, but stunning cardinals and blue jays, a dozen all told.  
  
For the better part of an hour, they flitted and sang and danced their way in and around my evergreen, landing on branch tips often enough to look like the richest of ornaments, and then darting off to play again.  
  
They crossed paths around the tree like a liquid garland being wrapped from top to bottom, braiding themselves across its wide expanse until they finally rested, satisfied, from their holiday decorating extravaganza.  
  
Fiber optics just lost their lustre, and I saved a chunk of change.
