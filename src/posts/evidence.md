      I guess I'm a strange oxymoron of sorts... I adore computers, but still prefer to read and edit in hard-copy. There's just something extremely taxing about reading on the CRT (I don't yet have a plasma or LCD monitor, so maybe that's different?)... And I tend to skim-read much more onscreen.  
        
      Whether it is a condintioned paradigm or not, paper is just...real. The reader can hold it and feel it and read it in a way that seems to penetrate the core of humanness. (Maybe there's a little bit of psych-corporeal absorption going on too -- a strange kind of paper-to-human symbiosis.)  
        
      Sure, scientifically, this is all BS, but I believe it... I feel it.

      I have loved reading as long as I can remember. Not growing up with a TV, books were the gateway to imagination and worlds outside my rural upstate NY bubble. Every day, I sit and stare at a computer as I design. I read many blogs and articles (which I typically print out anyway). Indeed, technology is wonderful tool ... but to me, sitting in a deep leather chair with a steaming cup of hot chocolate and a great novel (with paper pages that you turn) ... now that is a great evening.  
        
      A lady I know had been working on a devotional/prophetic writing book for several years. Recently, I helped put it all together for her - taking all the writings, organizing them and laying them out into a book. The excitement and joy expressed on everyone's part (it was a several month process) to finally see that first printout was so awesome to see. It suddenly became "real" and tangible. No longer was it a MS Word file, but suddenly there was a stack of crisp black ink on 216 white pages. Now it is printed, bound, and for sale ... but the first print out... such fun!

      Timsamoff--I'm glad you mentioned paper-to-human symbiosis. I was thinking that. Sure, I was! Yes, paper is real. Even my son Kevin--no great fan of books--thought it was "cool" to see what I was working on in hard-copy form. Now he more easily believes that I'm doing something--as do I.  
        
      Lisa--Your observations make me all the more want to meet YOU in person, though getting to know you in this way has seemed pretty real, too, don't you think?  
        
      Joshua--Upstate NY? My husband is from Rome--where did you grow up? You have really experienced my feeling first-hand--a book in hand is worth how many word docs? I'm pleased for your friend's accomplishment, and it's great that you could help her bring her book to fruition.

I miss them now that I live in the cornfields of Indiana. What many people do not know about NY is that the entire state is not NYC, but it is mainly rural - with sleepy towns and cities scattered all over the mountains and valleys."

Doug moved with his family to KC at age 18, but has never stopped missing the wonders of upstate NY. I saw it for the first time last summer, and it is fabulous. I could SO be happy there!"

      This scared me to death. I've posted almost 100 essays at my blog and they are like children to me. Granted, both my hard drives would have to go down at once, and then salon.com would have to blow up at the same time for me to lose them.  
        
      But suddenly nothing seems real. I'm going to print them all out and put them away somewhere.

Someday, when I'm old and gray (OK, not that far away!), I'll open that box, pull out those passe-technology disks and say, \"Honey, what in tarnation ARE these?\" That's another reason to occasionally print, IMO. Thanks!"

I don't trust computers the way some people don't trust banks.  
  
You know the kind of folks who really believe all that nonsense about how if you had $100,000 on deposit in the bank and you went to withdraw all your funds in cash, they wouldn't exactly have it? That they'd have something like $7000 of your money, and the rest would have been loaned out to needy individuals and businesses?  
  
Yeah, those people. Well, I'm just like that with computers.  
  
Today I bit the paper-and-enormously-expensive-ink bullet and printed out my novel-in-progress. Then I three-hole-punched and bindered the 130 pages, and I've been smiling at it ever since.  
  
It's a book now, in my mind--an incomplete one, a largely unedited one, but a book. It turns out I'm way more of a hard-copy kind of woman than even I knew. There's something so hopeful about finally holding in your hand the evidence of things not seen.  
  
I've feel like I've just been to the bank and pulled out all my cash in small bills.
