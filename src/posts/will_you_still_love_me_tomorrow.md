      Katy, you can put on pajamas any old time you want. No hour is too early! And guess what else? You can go to Starbucks in them, too! And also? Target! The people at Target don't even notice.

I'm a bit inhibited that way. I come from a generation in which women actually got out of bed in the morning to put make-up on, and then got back in bed so that their hubbies wouldn't have to wake up and see them without make-up. I'm not kidding! I am NOT one of these women, but I know them."

"Babe," I say, "I'm exhausted. All I want is to go put on some comfy old pajamas and relax. But it's still so early...would you mind?"  
  
"Not at all," Doug says.  
  
I take a peek at the clock and try to tell myself no one should be putting on PJs at this hour, but I can't resist the temptation. "But, really, it's only 5 o'clock. Will you still respect me?"  
  
"In the morning? Yeah."  
  
I squirm a little. "But what about tonight? There's a whole lot of hours to get through before morning."  
  
"Hmmm...you're right about that."  
  
We both laugh, but just to be on the safe side of an old cliche, I'll think I'll hold off a little while longer.
