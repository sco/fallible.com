      Michael--I'm enjoying your website, which is not to be confused with Michael Main's. I like your writing about your fam. Thanks!  
        
      Deb--Your pic is beautiful and either you're really young, or the 4 miles a day is working its magic! I am so impressed. It wouldn't be fair to say I'm jealous, though, since I could be in shape, too, if only I'd, well...you know. :)  
        
      Bethany--Yours is a day I love to make!  
        
      Lisa, So it hasn't been six years...it was just last year! Now, see, that doesn't sound bad at all. "I really need to start exercising regularly again. I was doing so well last year..." So what if you only swam for 2 weeks? It COUNTS, Lisa!! If it doesn't, I am lost.... ;)

![](/img/clock.gif)"So what do you do all day?" Dr. Laura asked.  
  
The caller, a young stay-at-home mom, had just complained to Dr. Laura that she wasn't accomplishing anything with her days. Evidently, she often found herself still in her pajamas when her husband arrived home in the evening, with no good excuses.  
  
"Well, I watch TV and I'm on the Internet a lot. Oh, and I email my friends every day. We instant message, too."  
  
"But you don't do anything," Dr. Laura said. "What news could you have to tell your friends if you don't do anything?"  
  
Then, to my personal dismay, Dr. Laura described her typical day, which starts with the alarm clock shrieking at the ungodly hour of 5:30 am. Unbelievably, she doesn't hit the snooze button. No, instead she gets dressed and walks for a full hour on her treadmill while she watches the morning news. By 6:45, the hardest part of her day is already over, and then she's ready to take on the world.  
  
It's been about a month since I heard this conversation, and I haven't set my alarm since. I have trained myself to awaken naturally, with the birds or the light or the rooster a couple of houses over or the train in town, or whatever. Suffice it to say, I do wake up--and it's almost always at the crack of 6:30.  
  
No sooner do my eyes fall upon the digital clock than I think of Dr. Laura. This morning, I turned to Doug (who was sound asleep) and groaned, "Honey, Dr. Laura's already been up a whole hour...she's already exercised, caught up on current events, and is ready to go do the right thing...."  
  
He opened his eyes, turned his head, and took in the time.  
  
"Relax," he said. "She's got nothing on you. Her alarm won't go off for another hour. She's in California, remember?"  
  
I snuggled up to him, smiled, and closed my eyes. I guess I really do have it all.  
  
What could be better than a comforting husband in Central Daylight Time?
