I'm sitting at my desk, intently working. Eighteen-year-old Kevin enters.  
  
"Why did you yell for me?" he asks.  
  
"I yelled for you?" I ask, without looking up from the computer. I am momentarily flustered, but it won't last. I keep writing.  
  
"You called me away from washing the dishes," he says, like I wouldn't know it if I'd done that. He's just trying to get his hands out of hot water.  
  
"If I had called you," I answer, "I'd remember why."  
  
"Well, you did." He sits down on the bed and reaches for the remote.  
  
"Is there something you want to talk about?" I ask, just in case.  
  
"No." He clicks the on button.  
  
"I don't have anything to talk about right now, either, so why don't you go finish in the kitchen?"  
  
"Because I don't want to." Now we're getting somewhere. He switches channels till he finds the soccer game.  
  
"Go return Nathan's call, then." I sound like I'm grasping at straws.  
  
"No." He switches channels.  
  
"Kevin, darling?" I still haven't looked up.  
  
"What?"  
  
"I'm gonna kill you."  
  
"Why?" He turns off the TV.  
  
"It seems like the right thing to do."  
  
Within seconds, the water is running in the kitchen sink, proving once again that the experts are wrong.  
  
Threats definitely work.
