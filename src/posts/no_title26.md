    text: "Hey, Bethany! You should ask your friend Lindsey to explain what a \"garter belt\" is. When going through my mom's house to empty it, I found my garter belt from when I first wore nylon stockings (not pantyhose) in the seventh grade. It's a bonafide relic. Doug thinks it's a wild pair of panties! ;)"

The way this year's gone, I finally decided to keep a packed overnight bag in the car, just in case. And I'm not talking in case we decide to stop off at a quaint B&B for the night. The bag has served me well and often, including when the doc at the ER decided to admit me a couple of Sundays ago. I knew I had the basics with me, the most basic of basics being underwear. I'd gotten my hair cut a few days earlier, which was good since I went combless and brushless for the ensuing five days. I'd forgotten to pop a brush into the bag. I'm thinking God gave us five fingers on each hand for a reason. The underwear situation was OK for a couple of days, which gave Doug some time to get his bearings before I came begging for a supply from home. The laundry was all caught up, with properly folded piles and everything. Furthermore, as I'm the only woman currently residing in the home, I couldn't imagine he would find this assignment difficult. "Bring me three pairs, just in case I'm here a while," I said. The next day, when he visited, I inquired after my underwear, already knowing in my heart of hearts that he'd forgotten. For that very reason, I'd kept one pair in reserve. "I knew I was forgetting something!" he said. Technically, of course, he was forgetting everything, since underwear was the only thing I'd requested. He made up for it the next day. "I brought four pairs," he announced, proud that he'd overcompensated by a full pair. I pulled them out of the plastic bag. One pair of panties, two bras and a girdle. He claims he mistook them all for panties. I'm not that kind of girl.
