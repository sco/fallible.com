      Did he design your blog? Because I really really like your site design. It just suits your blog so well.  
        
      It's a rare man who can keep up with the times. At least he's not sliding into obscurity, you know? ;)

      Irene, He did design it. It'll be three years old on Dec. 15, so it's probably due for a re-design, huh? I've loved it, though. I've been a quilter, and the silver fountain pen and journal at the top are mine. The picture of the little girl sewing is a sampler my dear friend Leslie made just for me. It is a treasure.  
        
      My guy, obscure? Not gonna happen!

One time, Doug did say \"crud,\" but it was under unusually trying circumstances, and twenty more years have gone by without a repeat offense. Not much excitement in that department! ;)"

      Gosh, I hope this doesn't turn into some cheesy novel where your husband turns out to be a mafioso and he just kept you baffled all these years by spouting technogibberish :)

    text: "Irene, I am somewhat change-averse myself. And I'm all about \"feel.\" I will take your kind words under advisement. They may just prevent my hubby from hours of re-design! (I'd have him rearrange the furniture instead, but I don't like change...)"

Some women are golf widows, others are hunting widows, still others are football widows. They may not see much of their husbands, but I'll bet they can tell you what the guys do for a living.  
  
For almost twenty-seven years, I've been a new-media widow.  
  
It all started with a 35mm camera back in the late seventies. I couldn't even use an Instamatic without decapitating my witless victims, so there was little chance I would understand the intricate workings of his new love.  
  
He took a continuing ed class for six weeks or so, shot exactly one roll of film, had it developed, and starting hawking himself and his portfolio. He got an entry level job doing *something* at a company that was just beginning to get into multi-media slide production.  
  
And the rest, as they say, is his story. To tell you the truth, he lost me at *slides*.  
  
He's been a photographer, a corporate filmmaker and director, a video producer, a project manager, a digital editor, a graphic artist, a website designer, a creative consultant, and a new-media business owner.  
  
His latest reinvention of himself involves implementing portal systems, incorporating integrators, and  
making sure he continues to position himself as the value-added man who can make it happen.  
  
Last night, we tried to talk about it all, and the conversation ended as usual.  
  
Katy: "I don't understand one word you just said. Exactly *what* is it you do for a living? My mother keeps asking..."  
  
Doug: "It's simple, really. I ,,$#%gtp\*&. Then, #$)\*@!!\_\_)\*&/<> $\*:!!)>??\*&/%."  
  
Katy: "I don't get what you do, but you understand *completely* what I do. You could *so* write a novel..."  
  
Doug: "Yeah, except for that one part."  
  
Katy: "The blank screen?"  
  
Doug: "The blank screen."  
  
So I'm a new-media widow. As long as I never have to face a blank screen, I can handle it.
