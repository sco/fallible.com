    text: "Okay, Katy.... two things, neither of which have anything to do with this particular blog post:<br><br>1) I read your November 7, 2001 entry. I almost laughed out loud.<br><br>2) When can I read this novel? ;)<br>"

    text: "katy, if you haven't yet, you should read \"girl meets god,\" by lauren winner. it's quite good, and i actually thought of you when i was reading it - that you'd enjoy it. it's alternately amusing and touching. (lisa, you should read it too, if you're so inclined. or anyone really! :) )"

    text: "Michaela, You're going THAT far back with fallible? Wow. I love you! Glad for any entertainment value I can offer. THAT novel is on a back burner with a blown element--it was a first attempt. My recent attempt at a novel is similarly languishing--or maybe I'm the one languishing? I'm having a crisis of confidence, at the least.<br><br>Bethany, Scotty gave Carrie \"Girl Meets God\" for her bday in March. I really want to read it! Now I will for sure. Thanks."

    text: "Sara--I finished Memoir and it's great. It's an older lady's story (she's maybe 53?) so I can really relate to it. We share lots of the same church experiences. Sometimes, I gasped aloud at the similarities.<br><br>Annie and Kari, I started Girl Meets God yesterday and love it so far. Thanks for recommending it! Annie, your style is so your own, there is no stopping you from writing your story!"

![Stained](http://www.fallible.com/img/stainedglass.jpg)I just purchased *Memoir of a Misfit: Finding My Place in the Family of God*, by Marcia Ford.  
  
On the way home from Barnes and Noble, Doug asked what it's about.  
  
"It's about a woman's struggle to hang on to God, even though she's never quite felt she fits in anywhere."  
  
"What do you mean, she doesn't fit in?" Doug is not thrilled with this topic, I know, since he fits in well wherever he finds himself, blooms where he's planted, and well...you get the idea.  
  
Is it my fault he chose to marry a misfit?  
  
"She was raised a Baptist, became a Charismatic, and now attends a liturgical church."  
  
He bristled slightly at the word "liturgical," and since I enjoy it when he bristles, I went on.  
  
"Liturgical's not against the *rules*, you know," I teased. "Liturgical's *OK*..."  
  
"Oh, *liturgical's* OK," he agreed smoothly, his voice losing all its apprehension. "Just not *lethargical*."  
  
I'd follow him anywhere.
