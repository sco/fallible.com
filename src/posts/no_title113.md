      I read somewhere that if we didn't have the cracks, His light wouldn't shine out.  
      I like that! :)  
        
      I loved your observations of the human condition.  
      We truly are..."One of a Kind!"

Doug gave me a beautiful collector's doll from Ireland for our 25th anniversary. Her name is Caitlyn, and there will only ever be 2500 made exactly like her. Mine is certified to be number 63 of 2500. What happens after they make 2500 Caitlyns? The mold is broken. The mold must be broken, I know, in order for the doll to hold its value. The fewer there are like her, the more desirable she becomes, both to her creator and to the ones who cherish her. God the Father is the consummate collector. One by one, he carefully crafts human beings in His image, in His likeness, but unique. One by one, he breaks each mold. Sometimes, I think He shatters the mold at the instant of conception, when all the potential for a person's life is fully present and just beginning to multiply. How better to safeguard each creature's value? After all, it's relationship He's after-a unique relationship with each of His children. Sometimes, though, I wonder if the breaking isn't a lifelong process, if the shattering doesn't rather happen in slow motion, fracture by fracture, splinter by splinter. Until, at the end of life, each child stands before Him alone, unique, completely finished and set apart for eternity's purposes. Either way, the mold is broken. It's just that sometimes, I can put my fingers in the cracks.
