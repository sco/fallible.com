      My husband was completely unaware of my toothbrush hang-ups until he read this. I should tell you that he says he makes no conscious decision to place his brush in any particular hole (namely, the one closest to my brush). It just happens. So.

      Carrie, honey--I'm sorry you had to find out this way, but it's better than hearing it on the street. ;)  
        
      Amber--Thanks for commenting! I've been enjoying your site just now. Tell me, what is this book you're writing? (If you don't mind sharing.) You are an accomplished writer!

      Julianna, OK. I don't know when I've ever read anything better than this. I exclaimed so loudly over your comment (at 6:30 am) that Doug came running from three rooms away to see what had happened! He still claims to be unaware of his toothbrush's romantic intentions, but I know different. Women just know.  
      Hang on to Tim! He knows how to make a girl happy she wears glasses!

      Kelly, Thanks for visiting here. Now I'm off to check out your site!  
        
      Amber, A girl must do what she must do! Go forward, young woman!  
        
      Tim, Yeah. I thought about the embarassment thing after I gushed about you. I should think earlier in the process, huh? ;)  
        
      Lisa, Towels can be a sore subject. Doug has an aversion to getting the bath mat wet when he steps out of the shower. I do not understand this, since I believe that's why God made bath mats. Anyway, to prevent the mat from becoming moist, he often grabs a towel to protect the mat. Of course, it's not his towel, since it is otherwise occupied. It is my towel. But, as the Scripture says, love covers a multitude of sins. I just wish that my towel covered only my body!  
        
      :)

You know the kind of toothbrush holder that has four holes in the top, so the average American family can share it? That's the type Doug and I have in the master bath.  
  
Two toothbrushes, four holes. Lots of space to stake a claim. Perfect, right?  
  
When I place my wet toothbrush in the holder, I put it directly opposite his, with the bristles facing out, on the side closest to my sink. Kind of like when I turn away from him in a queen-sized bed, and prefer to face my end table.  
  
When Doug puts his brush away, he snuggles it into the vacant hole right next to my brush, even if mine is still dripping wet, and he points the bristles squarely in my direction.  
  
What's more, I am gathering evidence that he even turns my brush's bristles to face his so they're nearly touching, almost kissing.  
  
It kind of freaks me out. It's like our toothbrushes have boundary issues.  
  
The thing is, our toothbrushes are identical, having been free gifts from the dentist in exchange for giving him our retirement money every six months. Sometimes, if they're nestled too close together in their little spot, I cannot tell them apart. The older they get, the closer they come to resemble each other, even though he is much harder on his than I am on mine.  
  
My little brush struggles in vain to hang onto its identity. They're a great couple, but sometimes this oneness thing can be overwhelming.  
  
There's a brand new purple toothbrush in the linen closet that I'm thinking of using. If I do, I'll sidle it up nice and close to that white one in the next hole over, and lose my fear of confusing one with the other.  
  
And then I'll hop in bed and roll to the middle to kiss the man I love.
