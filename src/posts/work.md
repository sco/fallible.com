      Actually, it is only WORK writing that is more difficult. I can write emails and blog with no difficulty, but when it comes to actually writing something for work, my mind short-circuits and leaves me facing a blank computer screen, with all my notes fanned out by the side of the keyboard, staring at me accusingly. It's good to know I'm not alone ;)

      And one of my favorite writing quotes is, "The wastebasket is a writer's best friend." (Isaac Bashevis Singer)  
        
      Wish I had the time to write............

      Irene, And sometimes the secret is to never let yourself believe that writing is work. Even if you do creative writing for your job.  
        
      Brandy, Yeah, I love that one, too.  
        
      Bridget, Oooooh, you're so brave. I rarely throw anything away, though I end up actually using very little.

An astute observation:  
  
"A writer is somebody for whom writing is more difficult than it is for other people."  
\--Thomas Mann
