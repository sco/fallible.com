A few posts down (See "On the Edge"), I wrote about "pushing the envelope." Alert reader Tim (Dave Barry's not the only one who has alert readers!) commented about the origins of the phrase.  
  
I have to admit I knew nothing of these origins! And so, dear readers, without looking at Tim's astute comment, can any other among you explain the term "pushing the envelope"?  
  
It's pretty pitiful that I didn't at least google the darn thing before I started writing, but since I didn't, you can't either!  
  
Any guesses?
