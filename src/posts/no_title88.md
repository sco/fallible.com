If you've seen Niagara Falls, you've really seen something. But for a wonderful town, travel another twenty minutes to Niagara-On-The-Lake. Doug and I enjoyed a leisurely couple of hours there on our family's vacation, and I thought I was in heaven. Picturesque Victorian homes and shops decorated with maple trees, lilac bushes and window boxes bursting with petunias. Orchards and vineyards and wine-tastings and antique stores. Not to mention Bed and Breakfast places. "It's too perfect," I said, on our way back to plain old Niagara Falls. "Mark my words, there's an ax murderer living in the shadows on one of these farms--there has to be." And then I saw the sign posted by the winding lane leading to the most beautiful farm of them all. "Cold Drinks, Maple Syrup, Pure Honey, Fudge." So that proves it, then, doesn't it? Niagara-On-The-Lake really is the most perfect place on earth.
