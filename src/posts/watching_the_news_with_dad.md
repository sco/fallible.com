![Scotty and Mary McKenna](http://www.fallible.com/scotty-mary.jpg)My mom and dad's wedding picture sits on top of the entertainment center. Last night, I watched the president's speech and the coverage from Iraq along with them. Mom's expression never changed from one of girlish innocence, but Dad's eyes took on a look I recognized from living eighteen years with him.  
  
Suddenly, he wasn't an I-just-married-the-best-girl, got-the-world-on-a-string, happy-go-lucky Scottish immigrant. He was the man I knew, the one whose eyes welled up with tears during *A Bridge Over The River Kwai* and *A Bridge Too Far*, but who almost laughed when Ali MacGraw died in *A Love Story*.  
  
The one who spent eight years in a Scottish regiment of the British Army, beginning at the age of seventeen and who, because of it, never graduated from high school. The one whose best friend was gunned down right beside him, the one who fought in both Northern Africa and in Sicily, the one my mother took care of for years during his recurring bouts with malaria.  
  
The one who became an American citizen when I was a little girl, but who was never honored along with American veterans of WWII. The one who didn't expect to be honored.  
  
The one who didn't want to talk about it, who fought to remember it, and who struggled to forget it.  
  
I looked up at the wedding picture once more as anti-aircraft missiles began to explode over Baghdad, and heard my father's proud voice resonate with the one political speech that dominated our home when I was a child.  
  
My eyes filled with his unwept tears, and my face became a bridge the rivers ran over. And I honored him.  
  
"I have nothing to offer but blood, toil, tears, and sweat. We have before us an ordeal of the most grievous kind. We have before us many, many months of struggle and suffering.  
  
You ask, what is our policy? I say it is to wage war by land, sea, and air. War with all our might and with all the strength God has given us, and to wage war against a monstrous tyranny never surpassed in the dark and lamentable catalogue of human crime. That is our policy.  
  
You ask, what is our aim? I can answer in one word. It is victory. Victory at all costs - Victory in spite of all terrors - Victory, however long and hard the road may be, for without victory there is no survival."  
  
Winston Churchill, from his first speech to the House of Commons after being appointed Prime Minister, May 13, 1940.
