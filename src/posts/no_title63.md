My friend [Anne](http://bananie.blogspot.com/) writes: "I am calmly aware that I am on the threshold of all things new." You know what I love about a threshold? As opposed to, let's say, a precipice? With a threshold, the only time your feet actually leave the ground is when Someone wonderful carries you over. "The precipice of all things new" just wouldn't be the same.
