      Katy---I thought you might like to know about Cause (www.cause-usa.org). This is another organization that aims to help U.S. soldiers---specifically those who have been severely wounded in Iraq. It was started by a bunch of West Point graduates and their families.

      Wisely said...  
        
      The problem you addressed is exactly the motivation behind the act. People flock to this type of support because it screams, "Look at me I care".  
        
      I admire you looking for something real. Real caring means that your support doesn't need acknowledgement. It just needs to make a difference.  
        
      ? Nice blog  
      It looks like I have my work cut out for me playing catch-up on all your posts.  
        
      Take Care

      Thanks, Allegra! I am truly so ignorant of what's involved in serving in the military. My dad served 8 years in the British army in WWII, but since then no one in my family has served. My husband and brothers-in-law all lucked out as far as their draft numbers went in the Vietnam era. I've only corresponded with one soldier ever--when I was 13, my best friend's brother was stationed in Guam, and I had a huge crush on him, so we wrote back and forth.  
        
      I'm thinking it's time I learn about and understand a bit of what these soldiers are going through--and then do something to make their lives easier.  
        
      Yeah. I think it's time.  
        
      Both of these organizations look equally terrific to me!

      Michael, I heard the soldier's mother on the radio yesterday--the lady who runs operationac.com. I like to imagine that our soldiers have everything they need, but often (I'm just now realizing...) that just isn't the case. I mean, who knew they didn't have a Payless Combat Boot store in Fallujah, running a buy one pair, get one half off sale? When their boots wear out, they could be really suffering while waiting and hoping for a new pair. This is the kind of stuff we can do something about!  
        
      I love the motto on the site Allegra points to:  
      "Here for you while you're there for us."

      i can report that my freestar is bumper sticker free, though i was tempted to purchase and slap on a MOPS logo while in nashville last month...then again, i actually do spend lots of time, thought, energy, and action living out this fine organizations' philosophy in a church here at home, so i wouldn't have had that 'peel, stick, be satisfied' syndrome to go with the act. I'm just not sure this is where my focus will be next year when my girl skips off to kindergarden, and then what? is there an easy method of bumper sticker removal? do i plaster over? could this become an actual driving hazard.."bumper in front of you, due to extreme sticker layering, is closer than it appears..."  
        
      food for thought, for sure...

      Okay. Lisa gave me my laugh for the day!  
      "Bumper is closer than it appears..." I can't tell you how many bumper stickers I would have plastered over by now, if I'd ever applied the first one! (Your devotion to MOPS has been wonderful, but a new season beckons...and new shiny stickers await!)

Okay. I've whined about how sick I am of all the ribbon-shaped bumper stickers that have flooded the market in the past few months, even the ones with wonderful sentiments like "Support Our Troops."  
  
Maybe I've just been frustrated because sticker-slapping seems too easy. It's almost gotten to the point where all you have to do to consider yourself a supporter of a worthy cause is wear a pin or dress your car in stickers or tie a yellow ribbon 'round the old oak tree.  
  
Don't get me wrong. I'm not looking for another cause that consumes my entire life or anything. Hey, I've got my mama, remember? But is it expecting too much that whatever effort--large or small--I choose to make in support of a cause is actually meaningful is some substantive way?  
  
For any of you who really want to support our troops, check out [this organization](http://www.operationac.com). It's a non-profit, run by the mother of a soldier in Iraq. She's done an incredible job of figuring out what the troops need and meeting those needs. You can adopt a soldier to send cards and care packages to, if you enjoy that sort of thing. Or you can use pay pal to make a donation.  
  
Forget sticker shock. I'm looking for something real, and this morning I found it.
