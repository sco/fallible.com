      that's weird. someone else said they weren't able to go to mine for a few days, either. try it again - perhaps it will work now for you.

Just a programming note: Blogger's not working on my computer, and neither is my comments feature. Both are fine on Doug's computer, though, so I can blog and check comments from here if I can pry him loose. I am also completely and mysteriously unable to go to Bethany's site, and Bridget's. I am sad.
