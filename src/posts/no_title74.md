      You sure it was a cigarette they were passing?! :)

The two young men sauntered past my locked car in midtown Kansas City, where I sat waiting to meet up with some girl friends of mine. They began arguing then, gesturing more explosively with each step, until I wondered if the only thing preventing them from coming to blows was the cigarette they passed back and forth. Or possibly a shared philosophy, stated succinctly on one's t-shirt: "The best way to predict the future is to create it." I'm thinking the shirt was a gift.
