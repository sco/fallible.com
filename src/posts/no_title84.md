This morning, I watched a worship service happen before my eyes. "I want to see You..." The father removed the baby boy from his car seat with a carefulness, a reverence, a certain holiness. The infant looked up at him, trusting. "I want to hear Your voice..." The father held the child to his heart, and bent to whisper his love. "I want to know You more." The baby almost understood the father's love, and smiled. The father smiled back, praying his son would someday know the height and length and width and depth. "I want to touch You..." The boy fumbled to lay hold of his father's face, and latched onto his ear with his little fist, and pulled on it. The father kissed the top of the baby's head. "I want to see Your face..." The father turned to face the child head on, and their eyes locked. The child loosened his grip on the father's face as he fell into his gaze. "I want to know You more." This morning, I touched the heart of heaven, just two rows away. Lord, I want to know You more.
