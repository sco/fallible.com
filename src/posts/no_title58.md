The generation gap used to be a big problem when I was young woman. We felt our mothers were materialistic, while we were idealistic. We felt they were self-absorbed in their conservatism, while we were actively engaged in making the world a better place by casting our virgin votes for George McGovern. Now that I'm of a certain age, I think we exaggerated the gap unnecessarily back then. I think I've been able to reduce the post-modern mother/daughter gap to a simple formula: Young women find panty lines unacceptable. Women my age find them...reassuring. Doesn't that just about sum it up?
