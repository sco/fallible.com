      Before Julianna moved to the cardiac clinic, she work on the med/surg floor... Believe me when I say that this sort of thing was a common occurrence.  
        
      By the way, is the term "hmmm-hmmm" applicable to people who are morbidly overweight?

      Tim--I in no way intended to denigrate the morbidly overweight with the term "sorry hmmm-hmmm." I was speaking about my own derriere (which has experienced its own episode of being morbidly overweight), and merely attempting to avoid the word "ass."  
        
      I meant for this post not to be about overweight as much as about my lifelong tendency toward couch avoidance. When I read the news story, besides feeling the horror of the woman's situation, I thought, "If I never lie down, they'll never have to extract me." Weird thought, I know, but still.

      Oh, no, Katy! I didn't mean to add...too much weight to the conversation... Ahem.  
        
      I was more just kind of wondering if "hmmm hmmm" stops at some point... Like, at what weight might it become "ho ho," or, "ha ha," or even..."uh oh"?

      If I'm completely honest, I guess hmmm-hmmm does have its limits. Hmmm-hmmm is a bit of a term of endearment, actually, and when mine gets away from me, quantity-wise, it ceases to be endearing to both me and the world at large. Oh, dear...  
        
      Is there any end to puns on buns?

I've always resisted having couches that were too comfortable. When the phrase *couch potato* was introduced, my resolve only strengthened. Who wants to be known--even by one's self, *especially* by one's self--as the chick who doesn't have the gumption to haul her sorry hmmm-hmmm off the sofa? Not I.  
  
The way I look at it, if the rest of my time on earth is getting one day shorter every twenty-four hours, I've got stuff to do. Stuff that can't happen in a supine position.  
  
Don't get me wrong: I can be as laid-back as the next woman, maybe moreso than many. But it's controlled laid-backedness. It's laid-back with a purpose. Maybe my brand of personal relaxation is so planned that it's something I need to speak to a qualified therapist about, I don't know.  
  
All I know is, [this](http://www.fallible.com/600PoundWoman.htm) isn't going to happen to me. Please believe me when I say I'm not *even* laughing.
