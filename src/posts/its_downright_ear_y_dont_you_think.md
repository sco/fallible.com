      LOL you are so funny. And what more funny is I'm laughing about a tumor related post. It sheds a whole new light on that old saying, "Oh, yeah, that was about as funny as a tumor."  
        
      And that wonderful attorney who wants to help people.... I liked this line from the study:  
        
      "The risk of developing a tumor \[from cell phone usage\] was double for those who started using a cell phone before their diagnosis."  
        
      So, um.... does that mean if I get a tumor now, I can still run out and buy a cell phone and have a fifty percent chance of getting money by suing the cell phone company? Well if that's the case Katy, I'd say that developing the tumor in less than ten years and on the wrong side still gives you a great case.  
        
      Seriously, though, what an ordeal. And it's likely that the cell phone does play a part in all of this. I'm glad I don't have one. (Wonder what my microwave is doing to my kids?) I can't wait for heaven when we can have all the fun without paying any of the price. I think we will ride on lions and be able to move through time and space in the blink of an eye. I think we'll be able to fly. Who knows? But it will be so far better than what we have now that all our techno-gadgets will look like silly toys and all that we can buy with money we win in lawsuits will look like dung. And in heaven there will be no illnesses, no pain, no fear, no loss. No sin to mar our relationship with Christ--we will feel his good will toward us every moment instead of slogging through life by faith. Wow. I can't wait.

      And here I thought I was the only person in the world who considered himself "left-eared." I haven't confessed this anywhere until now because, quite frankly, my keepers only need one really good excuse to throw away the key and this is just odd enough to do the trick.  
        
      Katy, is it possible you are also, like myself, left-footed (for punting or playing kick ball) and left handed?

I'll be monitoring this site periodically from e-mail cafe's (some things you just shouldn't miss, even while overseas) So I can see if you answer this demand: I want coffee with you and Doug when I return. No squirming out of this one! I think we've talked about this one for a year and I mean to do it! Remember! I am 95% sure of where you two sleep!

      Well... this blog got me into the habit of switching the cell phone back and forth between ears during a call now. My husband says, "Oh so you want a tumor on each side."  
      I think I am going to stop using my cell phone  
      except for dialing 911.

      Sally--I've GOTTA laugh about this stuff, since this kind of stuff is what my life's been made of! I refuse to live without a sense of humor...  
        
      Tina--I'm thinking a day late and a MILLION DOLLARS short, but who's counting? ;)  
        
      Michael--I am indeed left handed, although by default. I burned the palm of my right hand as a five-year-old, when I engaged in a foolish act of disobedience regarding an extremely hot iron. It was so long before I could use my hand that I was forced to learn to print with my left hand. So I'm actually ambidextrous, which makes up for the fact that neither of my feet have ever made contact with a ball!  
        
      Anne--So that's why I can't dance! Yes, I've assumed left-earedness went with left-handedness also. But having two recessive feet gets clumsy...  
        
      Christian--Coffee! Yes, coffee it is...Did you know that our Starbucks is actually a front for the Hibernians? My father wouldn't join up with them because he said they funnelled money back to Ireland to the...oh, never mind. When do you get home? In time for your brother's wedding reception, I hope...  
        
      Candace--Well, listen to your hubby! Having an acoustic neuroma on each side is called "neuro fibromatosis type-2." It's relatively rare, but can result in being deaf in BOTH ears--which, by my calcs, is approximately twice as bad as being deaf in one!  
        
      jozjozjoz--What a way to put it in perspective!! Thanks for the chuckle!

Usually, when I come down with one of those rare disorders/diseases that no one's ever heard of because only one out of 100,000 people in the general population contract it, I end up feeling pretty lonely.  
  
That's the way it was with my brain tumor. Until you heard about me, chances are you'd never known anyone who'd had an acoustic neuroma, which is the name for a benign tumor on the eighth cranial nerve--the one that controls hearing and balance.  
  
Evidently, my exclusive little club has a growing membership which consists of cell phone users who've been holding their phones to their ears for at least ten years. The incidence of acoustic neuroma is four times higher among long-term cell phone users, and the tumors invariably appear on the side of their heads where the phones have been.  
  
I still feel a little left out, though. Not only was my tumor removed five years ago, before we'd had a cell phone for ten whole years, but my tumor was on the right side of my head. I'm definitely left-eared and always have been--but even moreso now that my right ear is deaf.  
  
If only, if only, I'd been able to hold off a few more years. Maybe I could have held the cell up to my right ear a couple of times before calling [this man.](http://www.braininjury.com/attorney-acoustic-neuroma.html)  
  
Sigh. As usual, timing is everything.
