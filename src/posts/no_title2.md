    text: "Annie, girl! My Scotty was in Florence two years ago at Thanksgiving. Our first separation at holiday! He had me email him an recipe for stuffing, so he could make it for the other students. Only he had no cooking facilities. One girl said his stuffing was so good (she obviously missed her mum!) she felt compelled to propose to him. Alas, when she got home to her mom's cooking, the memory of his faded. You will be home soon, and what a celebration it will be!"

    text: "Bethany, \"The Florencian\" was a fellow KU student spending semester in France/Italy, though Scott did not know her before that semester (or any of the other students, I'm thinking.) Her proposal may have been influenced by heavy imbibing, I'm not sure. Maybe it was kind of like \"The Bachelor.\" People thrown together in a different world...she really, REALLY loved his dressing, but then the season ended..."

My daughter Carrie has been home for Thanksgiving break for all of an hour. After raiding the pantry and fridge (just to see some *real* food, she says) and shooting the bull with her dad and me, she retires to the piano. I can tell she misses it when she's gone. She plays and sings her way through her repertoire of ballads, sounding so beautiful I'm crying in the next room. There's one I'm yearning to hear called "I Need You At the Dimming of the Day," but I can't think of the name of it, or the tune. "Carrie," I call to her, "play that one I like..." "Which one?" "You know--the *one*..." "Oh, *that* one?" "Yeah, the one that *chick* sings--" "Oh, *you* mean--" "*That's it*." So she starts playing again, and singing--"just for you, Mom"--and I marvel at the gift God's given me, my grown-up little girl, only one thin wall away. I join her then, and the thanksgiving season begins.
