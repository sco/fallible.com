      I believe valentines day is in febuary, and most women I know don't carry their children to the full nine months term...

Of all the months, September--in my family--is the one with the most birthdays. I think we're up to eight now, double the runner-up month's tally. Is this just my family, or does it hold true for Kansas City in general? The dead of winter is terribly cold here. It never fails that on September 1, when most people are doing the Labor Day weekend thing, or buying backpacks and shoes for the beginning of school, or examining the neighborhood maple trees for the first tinge of change, I am thinking of my father. He was my very first September birthday, followed by a brother and husband and sister-in-law and many nieces and nephews. He was my first September birthday to die, too. Every day on the calendar surrounding his day is now filled with other celebrations, as if they were all born in September to give him one huge family hug. I thought of him this morning when a mood came upon me to tease my lovely daughter with a few of his words. She'd never heard these words before, and I don't think I've heard his voice parroting them in my head for over fifteen years. "Cheer up!" I said, in my imitation of my father's most fake cheerful voice. "Things could be worse." She looked at me, doubtful. Then, the voice changes into a morose, monotone one for the punchline. I delivered it as I remember it. "So I cheered up, and sure enough, things got worse." First she smiled, then we laughed. And I thought, So this is September.
