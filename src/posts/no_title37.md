All I did was innocently mention my dearly departed dad in this space at September's beginning, and I've dreamed of him every night since. Last night, he was giving me the royal silent treatment (as opposed to the regular silent treatment, because he's British). It seems he was a little peeved with me because he feels I've been neglecting him lately. I can't win.
