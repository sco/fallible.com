I was educated by the good Sisters of St. Joseph of Carondelet for thirteen years and something I must have learned from them--where else would I have gotten it?--was to think not in terms of having a career, but of having a vocation. A calling. Being the excellent student that I remain, I have resisted having a career to this very day. But a vocation! A calling! Now that's an entirely different matter. So imbued has my life been with a sense of destiny, that sometimes it's all I can do to face another sinkful of dirty dishes. In an effort to come closer to the types of "vocational moves" I should be pursuing, those which are consistent with the Divine purpose for me being on this earth (OK, really, your laughter is distracting me!), I've made a couple of helpful lists. The first one, labelled "I Am Not," includes such entries as "I am not a reporter, a researcher, a speaker at weekend women's retreats, a marketing guru, an expert in a field, a head of a ministry, or a compiler of the next Chicken Soup-type series." The second, "I Am," is comprised of items ranging from "I am a diarist, a humorist, a novelist, a commentator, an entertainer, a people-watcher, and an encourager," to the even less lucrative "I am an observor, a seeker, a poet, a lyricist, a storyteller, a slice-of-lifer and a conversationalist." In short, I am called to write personal stuff, and to touch the lives of readers along the way. If you made your own two lists of "I Am" and "I Am Not," how would the good Sisters of St. Joseph of Carondelet feel about your entries? Do you consider yourself to be "called" to your work? What criteria did you use (or will you use) to choose your educational or career path? Do you devote much--or any--of your thought life to questions about your destiny? Or is it just me?
