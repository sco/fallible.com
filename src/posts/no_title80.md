My husband has purchased a luxury for me: the services of two women who come once every two weeks to clean my house. I promised him that during the hours when they are here, if at no other time, I would get some serious writing done. That is why he hired them: to free me from the housework and to give me more time and energy to write. They are here today, and I sit here with my hands poised over the keys, listening to the sounds of the work I've done my whole life, smelling the scents of my previous employment. The broom is making its way down the back hall as my fingers begin to move, and I think I may find a crack in a coffee cup when I check later--I recognized a familiar sound when it clinked against the faucet. So I write. Not my novel, or a poem, or a piece of inspiration or humor. Just another line or two about looking back, and then about looking forward. Soon, I won't hear the cleaning noises anymore. Soon, it will become second nature to think of someone else doing my work. Soon, the characters in my novel will be speaking so emphatically, they'll drown out the competition. But today, I'm stuck between a past I am comfortable with and a future I still don't quite recognize. Today, nothing mystifies me more than the present tense.
