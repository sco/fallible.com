      dictionary.com gives three examples of \*effluent\*. i thought they were funny:ef?flu?ent ( P ) Pronunciation Key (fl-nt)<br>adj. <br>Flowing out or forth.<br><br>n. <br>Something that flows out or forth, especially:<br>A stream flowing out of a body of water. <br>An outflow from a sewer or sewage system. <br>A discharge of liquid waste, as from a factory or nuclear plant. <br><br>

The dear girl mentioned below has contacted me again to clarify that while she battles a frightful cold, she isn't coughing *much*.  
  
After checking my Webster's, though, I stand by my earlier description of her. Dry cough or productive cough, it matters not. She is effluent.
