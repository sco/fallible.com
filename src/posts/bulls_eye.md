![Bread alone](http://www.fallible.com/img/thumbnails/biscuits.jpg)"Is Dad OK?" Carrie asked, concerned.  
  
She had just treated us to a homemade batch of her own Red Lobster-style cheesy garlic biscuits. Our mouths were still watering when she told us she planned to bake them again for her college choir, which consists of large numbers of marriageable men.  
  
Doug had turned pensive, and had expressed privately to me that vast numbers of unscreened carb-lovers might soon be vying for her hand.  
  
"What do you mean?" I asked her, though I was pretty sure I knew the answer. "What did Dad say?"  
  
"He said I need to target my biscuits."  
  
All right, then.
