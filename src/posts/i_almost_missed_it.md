      I took care of my own mother and man, the medications list is something, isn't it? We kept it on the fridge for those times when we'd have to call the ambulance.  
        
      I'm with you in spirit, Katy. It's a really tough job.

This fall, I really, *really* looked forward to missing filling out tens upon thousands of forms for my last kid's senior year of high school. I wanted the chance to miss the sports physical form, the enrollment form, the medical release form, and the field trip permission form.  
  
I craved the opportunity to miss John Hancocking away my right to sue the school and all its representatives should anything disastrous and probably preventable befall my child when he's not under my watchful care.  
  
Right about now you're probably thinking, *what about notarization forms?* Ah, yes...la piece de resistance. What mother doesn't live for those special mornings when her kid is running out the door and yells, "Hey, Mom, I have to have this notarized by *first hour*"? Yes, Notarization Days were the best of all.  
  
Kev graduated in the Spring, and will be attending college this fall. I ain't filling out diddly squat on his behalf, and it's sad, sure, after 25 years of filling out forms.  
  
Just not *that* sad.  
  
Besides, new forms have a way of filling any void outdated forms may leave. In the past week alone, I've carted my mom to two new medical offices, and have filled out no less than fifteen pages of forms on her behalf. I have her entire medical history memorized, from the umbilical double hernia surgery at the age of eleven, to the Hepatits C she contracted from a blood transfusion when she gave birth to me, to 1989's shattered elbows (yeah, plural) now tenuously held together with pins and plates. I can spout off the names, dosage amounts, and frequencies of all her dozen or so meds in my sleep--and often I do.  
  
And with Mom, it's not just filling out and handing in. Each doctor's office, diagnostic imaging center, and emergency room has its own pile of forms they want us to have *for our records*.  
  
Yesterday was the last straw. I turned in the requisite pile of filled-in paperwork at the little window and the medical office clerk pounced. She thrust the papers in my face with a sarcastic smile and said, "Here's some HIPA forms, for your mother's records."  
  
I pushed the papers away. "No, thanks. She's been HIPA'd to death. You can keep your crummy forms."  
  
"OK," she said. "I understand. You don't have to take them, or even read them."  
  
Then she reached into a slot underneath her desk.  
  
"But if she's refusing to read and accept HIPA paperwork, she'll need to fill out this form..."  
  
Nostalgia is funny. Just when you identify something you think you're going to relish missing for the rest of your life, something else rises up to take its place.
