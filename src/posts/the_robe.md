      my wife likes big empty spaces to be neat, but leaves things like cabinets and closets in complete and happy disarray...i like a certain amount of clutter in big rooms (makes them feel lived in) but when looking in a closet and small spaces, i live with military like discipline...once or twice a year i can't handle it anymore and redo my wife's entire closet arrangement - talk about a baffled look!

Her closets, drawers and cabinets are unbelievably perfect. She's like two people. I like a general, but not too precise, orderliness everywhere. But I ALWAYS have to be able to find my robe! Does your wife enjoy it when you do her closet?"

![Hang Ups](http://www.fallible.com/img/thumbnails/hangers.jpg)"No *wonder* I couldn't find my robe! *Someone* hung it on a hanger!"  
  
I used my best accusatory voice to make this pronouncement, rolling my eyes toward the only suspect.  
  
"I did that," Doug answered.  
  
In my weirdly structured little universe, pajamas are hung on hangers and robes are hung on hooks. Pajamas are meant to be selected from among several organized choices. Robes are meant to be grabbed from a hook should modesty dictate or morning chill require.  
  
Before settling for number two on a hook which routinely holds three robes--my current favorite being on top, of course--I scoured the entire house for the missing garment. Bedroom, living room, kitchen, laundry room, back to the bedroom, scanning chairs, couches, hampers, floors and chandeliers. Robes don't just disappear.  
  
It's the first time in twenty-six years Doug has hung my robe on a hanger, and I hope it's the last. It was a nice gesture, but disorienting.  
  
Still, there was a certain logic to it, and it made me think about what other important stuff might be located exactly where it should be.
