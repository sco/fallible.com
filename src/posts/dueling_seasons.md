      "Hi! I'm Quirinius, your Roman Governor. I know you don't like that and I don't give a damn.  
        
      "There's going to be an election next Tuesday; and you're going to vote in it; and you're going to vote where I tell you to. If you've got a problem with that, your local centurion will be by with a couple of his guys and some chains and shackles. After we've had a little talk, I think you'll see things my way. (Not that it will do you any good at that point.) But if your idea of a good time is rowing galleys back and forth across the Mediterranean for the next fifteen years or so, believe me, I can arrange it.  
      So, be there. That's how it is."

You already know I'm starting to get in the Christmas spirit. Unfortunately, this year my Christmas spirit is colliding head-on with the tail-end of election season.  
  
Because of that untimely collision, I'm thinking stuff like this:  
  
If Joseph and nine-months-pregnant Mary could travel seventy miles on foot from Nazareth to Bethlehem with one donkey between them in order to obey the edict of the emperor (to fill out a census), why would a registered voter in America consider himself "disenfranchised" if he's simply required to vote in his own precinct rather than some precinct of his random choosing?  
  
Is there such a thing as Seasonal Overlap Disorder?
