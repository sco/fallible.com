So, here it is, Christmas Eve, and Iâ€™m already making New Monthâ€™s Resolutions.

I guess Iâ€™m early this year because our kids and grandkids have come and gone, at least as far as our big Christmas celebration goes. Iâ€™ve got the laundry done, clean sheets on all the beds, the house tidied up, the end-of-year finances tallied, andâ€”-this is a big one for meâ€”-the leftovers in the fridge dealt with.

Typically, after eating ourselves into a funk for a few days running, I canâ€™t bring myself to even open the refrigerator for upwards of two weeks after the holidays. And by then, you can imagine what it looks like in there. I may not have asked for or received fur in a classy box under the tree, but sure enough, it grows in the fridge for free. And I always feel terrible to think I didnâ€™t manage those leftovers better and ended up wasting perfectly yummy food.

Today, I attacked the leftover beast head-on and I think I conquered it. I packaged up and froze turkey (in small containers), dressing, pistachio salad, broccoli-rice casserole, cheesecake, and appetizers. And then I took my resolve not to waste food a step further. I decided not to purchase any groceries for the month of January, except for milk, eggs, and bread, and to focus exclusively on eating whatâ€™s already in this house. There are only two of us here, for heavenâ€™s sake. The huge tin of popcorn we received as a gift is alone enough to sustain us, if need be!

In addition to putting the kabosh on grocery purchases, why not take it another step? I have a few Groupons that must be used before their expirations dates, but other than spending those, we have NO need to enter a restaurant or make any online purchases at all. Even the wonderful gift cards we received this Christmas can wait to be spentâ€”-I bet weâ€™ll enjoy them a lot more in February after taking a consumption break during January.

Honestly, about the only thing I can imagine wanting during the first month of 2011 is a few more prints of my two new grandbabies, Silas and Juniper, to add to my Grandmaâ€™s Brag Books. For a few cents each, I may splurge on those.

All those after-Christmas clearance sales will have to get along without me this year, and Iâ€™m sure theyâ€™ll manage just fine. Enough really is as good as a feast!
