      indeed...we're still starting our days prying open one eye to deal with the four year old half dressed needing major wardrobe help and the boys rummaging through their lego box excitedly (is there a more grating sound to wake up to?)or fighting over one wearing the other one's shirt, and all three about to let us know loudly how HUNGRY they are for their BREAKFASTS...  
        
      not having had a honeymoon, we're going to take some honeymoon YEARS here in a decade or so...

The alarm went off a little late this morning, but we both groaned anyway.  
  
"7:10," he said.  
  
"KCMO on your radio dial," I answered.  
  
"North James Street," he said.  
  
"That's not where the radio station is..."  
  
"The house where I grew up in Rome, New York," he said. "710 North James Street."  
  
Then we laughed and hugged, and reveled in how little it takes these days to impress each other.  
  
Be patient, my good friends. After 28 years of marriage, you too may have the joy of starting your day like this.
