The wind is fierce.  
Racing through my grief,  
No gentle breeze, this--  
A terror, a portent, an omen,  
Pulling limb from limbs.  
Branches shorn:  
Rip root from ground.

The winds, they pierce.  
Devastating leaf,  
Flowers and grass kiss--  
Bent, bowed, then broken,  
Light through storm cloud dims.  
The veil is torn:  
Sweet Spirit’s sound.
