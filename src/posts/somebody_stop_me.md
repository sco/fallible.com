      I was just at the Apple store this afternoon in the plaza. i am visiting the International House of Prayer here in KC and thought I would venture around KC and see what there is to do. I happened upon the wonderful museum and this wonderful little italiannate village called the Plaza.  
        
      And yes... I am excited whenever anyone starts simplifying their life. It is so freeing! (I still want to read the book even though I am an almost minimalist.)

      Katy,  
      I had to check out your blog after your precious comments to me. I just finished reading your essay "Present of Christmas Past" and I must tell you that I'm wiping tears from my eyes and thinking about the amazing love of our Father and His care for these desires of our heart. Thank you for writing something so beautiful. My heart is whispering, "come, Lord Jesus."  
        
      I look forward to reading more of your essays. I feel like I've found a kindred spirit.  
        
      BTW, I know the joy of dejunking. I sat at my kitchen table this morning drinking tea. My journal, notebook, and Bible lay open before me and my husband and I discussed my latest question regarding God's grace and obedience and how to understand the two together. Anyway, the kitchen was clean, the crockpot already cooking supper for our family of six, and my husband had the bread machine working on home made bread for lunch. I suddenly was overwhelmed with a sense of gratitude for our home. You have to understand that it is a worn-out, lower middle class home with worn furniture and worn carpets and very little of the latest in terms of decorating. I often am not thankful for our home. I grow tired of the worn-out places and dream of a larger home where my four children, all of our home school supplies, my husband's home business, and my writing world can all fit better. I dream of having enough space that I don't have to cram three boys into one room and I fantasize about a room with a view, where I can write and look at nature through huge windows. Surely, I'd be a much better writer in that environment. But this morning all I felt was joy and peace and gratitude. Perhaps it was a holy moment.  
        
      And I had this thought "If I can just keep the clutter under control I can be happy here." It's when my desk is piled and the projects stack up and things aren't in their place that my house is something I'm unhappy with. (Or once in a while when the jealous monster visits or someone I don't know well and has a beautiful home is coming over. :o))  
        
      Anyway, didn't mean to run on and on like that, but I can certainly share in your joy of decluttering. Congratulations!! It is a huge feat of courage and skill and perserverance to do what you have done. You inspired me this morning.

      Does this mean you've thrown away all your bras and panties or that all you have left is your bras and panties?  
        
      I'm so confused :)

      Where does all the stuff come from? My wife and I were talking the other day about the days when our children were small and we didn't have anything. We lived on a tight budget. Our hobbies were cheap. Now we're still on a tight budget but our hobbies are expensive. Our house is a history of the hobbies we have embraced and abandoned. We have been marketed into poverty.  
      Hobbies get expensive because of marketing. Look at scrapbooking. How could it cost so much to make a scrapbook? Beads looks like the next big thing to come along.  
      I think I'll simplify my life. Find a cheap hobby. There's probably a book on the subject I can buy. And maybe some software to help me simplify my life. And then there's the journal. And the special pens. And the...

      Joshua--Hope you are enjoying your time in our fair city! I find it a wonderful place to live.  
        
      Paula--Your words are so kind! Thanks for visiting here and hanging out awhile. And yes, I so agree with you that managing our stuff increases our appreciation for all we have. I'm personally getting happier every day! Thank you so much.  
        
      Michael--Why am I not surprised? Men are chronically confused about ladies' underwear. Once when I was admitted to the hospital through the ER, I asked my husband to bring me a couple pairs of panties when he visited the next day. I told him not to forget, as I had not come to the hospital prepared for admission, and would be desperate for clean underwear. He didn't forget. He brought me two bras and a girdle... :)  
        
      Jennifer--Don't encourage him!!! (Tee, hee.)  
        
      Angus--OMG, you are preaching to the choir! My entire adult life has been about accumulating the trappings, but never the substance. It started at age 19 with the cute tennis outfit, expensive shoes and racket. I tried tennis exactly ONCE and knew I hated it. But I bought the expensive stuff before I even tried it! No more....  
        
      Deb--Have you been at it for long? Or are you a recent convert? I'm no where near as bad as the characters on Clean Sweep (I love that show!), but recently things had gotten too out of control for me to be able to function well mentally and emotionally. We'd closed down both of our mothers' homes and incorporated a bunch of their posessions into our home, and it just got crazy. But, girl, I am gonna overcome.  
        
      If I do keep writing about it, are bras and panties still fair game, too?  
        
      Michael--Don't answer that. :)

Okay. I never claimed to be completely free of at least a small tendency toward a significant obsessive/compulsive disorder. Never.  
  
So what could have prevented me from blogging for an entire week, especially when ever since the Grand Opening of The Apple Computer Store on the Country Club Plaza in Kansas City last Saturday, I've had my very own iBook? What?  
  
Stuff, that's what.  
  
My current estimate is that I've unloaded 1500 pounds of unneeded, unwanted, broken, useless, outdated, never-to-be-read-again, never-will-be-worn-again stuff. It may be closer to a ton by now, judging by the semi-constant huffing and puffing of the two heavy lifters in the family, Doug and Kevin. (Thanks, guys!)  
  
And I'm not done yet.  
  
But I've got a sense of freedom I haven't experienced for many years--if ever. One of the side benefits of getting rid of junk is developing something of an abhorrence for acquiring more of it, a reluctance to do anything to get entangled in clutter ever again. In other words, I've lost the will to shop.  
  
So I'm a little O/C. I gotta say that these past few weeks, it's been paying off for me, big-time.  
  
Just to prove that I'm not totally given over to my new found passion for dejunking, I'm going to hereby commit to never bloging about it again.  
  
Of course, you might recall that I said that about bras and panties, too.
