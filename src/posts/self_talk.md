      Writing a novel, I suppose, iis more of a journey than an endpoint.  
        
      And sometimes we don't realize the ground we have covered until we turn around and look behind us.

      Maria, You are my role-model for ground covering! My soon-to-be-doctor buddy. I sense that I am making inroads, and it's a wonderful feeling. Thanks!  
        
      Kelly, I commented on your blog entry about novel writing blocks. This is my third attempt at a novel, the first two ending at 8-12,000 words. ENDING. I hated those characters with a passion by then, and wanted nothing more to do with them. This time it was different! Somewhere along the line (40,000 words?) I decided not to write another word that wasn't part of an actual scene. That has helped me tremendously to move forward. Best wishes!

      Katy, that's great news -- to hear that the novel's almost done! Wow!  
        
      I have a theory that writers are their own harshest critics. Every time I read someone's writing, I think, "But s/he's so much better than I am... if only I could write like that!" And I certainly don't think I could write a novel... \*grin\*

    text: "Irene, Insecurities abound, huh? When I'm really writing, I don't know if it's better for me to read writers who are fabulous, or not. If they're wonderful, I get frightened. If they're horrible, I get arrogant. I could give up reading, like that's gonna happen. ;)"

I don't think a day in the past eight months has started without me sitting down in front of my computer, staring at the screen, and saying out loud *I can't do this.*  
  
In the past two months, I've added an addendum to my pathetic self-talk, and it is this: *But I'm doing it.*  
  
I ran across a journal entry of mine from months ago, and thought I'd share it.  
  
"I'm *never* going to feel competent to write a novel. My feelings of inadequacy are deep enough that I will have to write a book in spite of how I feel, and stop waiting for the day when my feelings change.  
  
It may turn out that I really am inadequate to write a book, that I just don't have what it takes. The only way I'll ever know for sure is to push through the feelings and work my butt off.  
  
Do I want to give up now? Because if I want to, I can. I can walk away and have a pleasant life doing absolutely...nothing.  
  
I feel called to write, but so often I feel incapable of fulfilling the calling. What if I just skipped the whole thing?  
  
How would I explain that to God when it's time to answer for my life?"  
  
The early morning negative self-talk persists. But the novel is almost done.
