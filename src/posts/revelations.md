      And you can guarantee that Jim will never get the chance to record on celluloid for all time my cellulite! Glad you're so skinny, you can do it! :)

(funny, we've never gotten around to the \"after\" ones ...) but its better than the most recent diet technique i witnessed in the cafeteria: one girl happily loading up her plate with carrots, wild rice, cottage cheese and soy sauce."

    text: "Sarge--I think BFL is great! A lot of folks on the diet board I belong to do it with wonderful results. It's just the before pics that freak me out....I really enjoy your site. I am favoriting it.<br><br>Lindsey--Hi, friend of Bethany's! (and therefore, of mine.) Young people--even pretty overweight ones--look so much better in befores than those pushing 50. As Erma Bombeck said, \"Gravity is a winner.\" Still, I will be brave.....<br><br>"

Have you seen all the before and after photos of men and women in their skivvies, for instance the folks who have embarked upon a Body for Life 12-week challenge? Can you believe they let someone take those pictures of them, with their rolls upon rolls of globular gushiness and cellulite smeared on top for good measure, and that they then publish the images in print or on the web for God and everybody to see?  
  
I've been married nearly 26 years, and I have fiercely clung to my dignity for each and every one of them, until today. I've never owned a pair of bike shorts or a racer-back (or is it razor-back? whatever) sports bra. Until today. I've never dreamed of requesting of my own volition that a man who still loves me photograph me in such revealing apparel.  
  
Until today.  
  
"Don't say a word," I hissed, as I emerged from the bedroom in my new outfit. "Just take the pictures, and fast."  
  
"You look..." he started.  
  
"NOT A WORD!"  
  
He took my befores in a hurry. Front, side and back, and one extra in which I posed in such a way as to show the utter patheticness of my upper arms.  
  
And, like the faithful man he is, he kept his lips sealed. But I couldn't help noticing he never stopped smiling.
