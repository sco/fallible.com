      I just cannot wrap my mind around this...even six months after. Though I knew noone who died or survived this ugly scar on our history, I feel deeply for those who have lost so much...time, friends, family, health, and of course, life. God help us learn from this horror something...anything good.

Six months have passed, they say, and for some of us, it's almost true. But for others, others, the mere passage of time is no longer the marker of a day well-spent or a life fully embraced. Does a month crossed off on the calendar move them any closer to a new ending or any further from a horrible beginning? One young wife and mother, Lauren, spent the first month of these six in a medically induced coma, in order to survive the pain of the rest of her life. Burns cover eighty-six percent of her body. She is missing most of an ear and parts of her hands, and doesn't look like the girl Greg married, unless he's looking deep in her eyes. He looks at all of her, though, loves all of her. Greg read her Robert Burns in those early days, and does still, not so she'll remember, but so she'll believe. "My love is like a red, red rose," he says, as he gazes upon his beloved. With tears streaming down her scarred face, she recites her love back to him wordlessly, breathlessly. She dreamed of her husband and baby boy that first faraway month, longed for them, and decided to live for them. A decision she'd already made every day until Day One, in every place before Ground Zero. How could she change her mind now? Her husband has compiled a book of his email communications with all her many friends over the course of these six months. It is called "[Love, Greg and Lauren](http://www.msnbc.com/news/722497.asp?cp1=1#BODY)." Lauren cannot read it yet, may never be able to. All of her strength must be focused on moving forward, or there will be no movement at all. She cannot risk a backward glance. Don't look back, Lauren. Not yet. Six months have passed, they say. And for some of us, it must be true.
