      Since my entry is about the different ways the sexes think, and I was really tired when I wrote it, I went with the shortest title I could come up that might convey the spirit of the post.  
        
      But now, Michael, you've got me concerned. So I asked Doug, "If people google 'sex,' aren't there a million sites they'd arrive at before they'd see mine?" And he said, "Well, yes, unless they add the word blog or something..."  
        
      You people may not believe me, since to you I may seem like I've been around the google block a few times, but I promise it's the truth: I am a search-engine-optimization virgin. Maybe I should change the name of the post to TPFKA Sex--would that help? :)

      Hey, Katy. I added your blog to my website links. Of course, now that you're going porn . . .(KIDDING!!!) ;o)  
        
      When I opened this and saw the title, I hesitated. It's like an R rating on a movie, ya know. I braced myself for TMI and plunged into a story about fantasy. Not sexual fantasy, though. Travel clothes fantasy. The irony (intentional or not) amused me.  
        
      I want to go to Ireland and Scotland, too. Maybe this summer. My son is studying in England, and we're considering joining him for a British Isles jaunt.  
        
      So, what's the name of that catalog? ;o)

      Jeanne--I just met with Doug and we discussed several acronyms for kinky behaviors before we came up with the meaning of TMI!!! We're still laughing...  
        
      Thanks for not giving me TMI about anything else I'd rather not know!  
        
      I do hope you get to go to the old country. My friends met their daughter, who was studying in England, a couple years ago, and they toured England and Scotland and had the time of their lives. It is so fabulous, you'll have a hard time leaving.  
        
      These paper catalogs are both online, but there's something about the paper....  
      www.travelsmith.com and www.NormThompson.com  
      There the only mail-order cataglogs (besides Victorian Papers) that I can't bear to throw away until the next one arrives. It's like they're the connection to my travel fantasies...er, dreams. :)

      Heh. I thought TMI was about as common an acronym as LOL. But that's probably because I have a friend who constantly gives "too much information" without even realizing it. I've written her as a character in my WIP. She's the comic relief.  
        
      Glad you and Doug got a laugh out of your brainstorming session. You best not share your kinky behavior results, though. TMI. ;o)

      You are a very groovy chick, that's all I can say. Every time I want to ask my daughter about her current relationship, I have to stop and think HARD to remember the letters. "So, have you and Marc had the...IRS? Um...DNC? PPO? Or is it PDA?"  
        
      "Mom," she says, knowing exactly where I'm trying to go, "It's DTR."  
        
      We really do communicate, she and I, and in quite a capital manner, I think.

Love those same catalogs, and have almost duplicate travel fantasys... though it's England and Scotland in mine. I think I've even showed those coats to my husband before, too! I actually bought him one that was more of a Safari style when we were first married, khaki with lots of pockets..."

    text: "Chris(tine)--DTR= determine the relationship. Fun, huh? I love the safari coats, too!! But, since we're so focused on the British Isles/Ireland, I'm thinking the camel blazer would look so beautiful with all the heathery colors....ah. I know I would love England, as well. We just haven't sampled it, yet--except for Manchester, where we've visited Doug's two girl cousins. My seven girl cousins live in Scotland, where Dad grew up, but his da was from Ireland, so we love it, too.....It's all so endearing and wonderful to behold!! Have you gotten to go yet? I hope you do! You will love it! Keep dreaming until then."

      You can say anything you want. That's why we are here because you say it so well. What a wonderful lady you are, especially when your feathers are all ruffled.

I am such a sucker for a good catalog filled to the brim with stuff which I could, technically, afford but which I wouldn't dream of dropping the big bucks on.  
  
I am crazy about travel catalogs, and can't get enough of pretend shopping for the perfect travel purse--the kind with compartments for everything including your passport and airline tickets. Of course, shopping for a purse without the right shoes, hat, and travel wardrobe makes no sense, so I pick out coordinating tencel shirts and pants and skirts and dresses, all with one requirement: they must be crushable, packable, absolutely wrinkle-proof under the most extreme conditions, and able to be washed in a hostel sink, hung to dry, and ready to wear again in a couple hours time.  
  
OK, I guess that's more than one requirement, but you get the idea.  
  
Such are the fantasies of a world-travel wannabe, of someone who envisions herself--and her husband--doing Ireland and Scotland in the near future and wants to pack as lightly and sensibly as possible.  
  
My favorite travel catalogs always have a men's section, too, and this one is no exception. I know just what Doug would like: a faux-suede camel colored, machine washable, wrinkle defying blazer with inside zippered pocket for airline tickets. Doug looks beautiful in camel.  
  
"Look, babe," I say, "only $199 for this great travel blazer. You would look wonderful in this. I can just see you traipsing along the auld sod, looking all Irish and foxy..."  
  
He looks at the picture. "It looks dressy to me. I don't think I'd want to get that dressed up on vacation..."  
  
"I'll tell you what," I say, "if I was a guy, that's the jacket I'd want."  
  
Twenty-year-old Kevin can contain himself no longer.  
  
"But, Mom, if you were a guy, you wouldn't think like you do now," Kevin says. "So how do you know what you'd want?"  
  
Oh, yeah. There's that.
