      Now that I see this on fallible, it really does seem Demerolian, doesn't it? Tee, hee.

Latent musings of a woman stoned out of her mind on Demerol, from a couple of weeks ago: It would be lovely if we could truly *know* everything we've seen, if nuances whispered their meanings to us in the light where we could at least read their lips, rather than in the darkness where we must also depend on interpreting their touch. It would be lovely, but too easy. I am more impressed with a deep knowledge than a broad one, even if that which is fully known by me is not unlike what is known by any other man. I would rather read one phrase which aptly captures love, and about which anyone might say "that's it!" than a library full of poetry which *almost* touches my soul. The one beautiful thing about the "almosts," though, is the way they challenge me to try the thing myself. To try myself to fashion the one apt phrase which, after it's written, I might read again, and sigh and say, that's it.
