      Hi, Simon! A couple people have reported this to me, and it happens when I click on fallible, as well. I have no idea why...I'll ask my techie husband if he can fix it--I don't want pop-ups, although this is a good one.

    text: "just a thought about the pop-ups. Could they be from a particular ISP or type of ISP (hi-speed, dial-up. etc.) since they are not consistant for all users?<br><br>PS Your blog is a highlight of my day. When you have a new posting (long or short - but long is better!) I eagerly read it savoring each word. Thanks for your creative insights to life!"

Are their Jewish dating services there?<br><br>Kat--I've forwarded your ideas about pop-ups to hubby, who still looked bewildered. Hmmm...Thank you for your kind comments. I hope to give you reasons to come back."

When you guys click on to my blog, do you get the pop-up ad for the Jewish dating service?  
  
How's that working for you?
