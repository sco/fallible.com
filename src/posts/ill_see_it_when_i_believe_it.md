I'm taking my mom over to the hospital this morning, for some pre-op testing. She's having knee surgery next Monday. (Oh, joy...)  
  
St. Joseph's has added so many wings and buildings that it's hardly recognizable anymore. I had to call over there just now to ask which building we should target.  
  
I could have just called the main number for the hospital, which I've had memorized since we started making ER runs with little kids 25 years ago. But I thought if I looked it up, there might be a direct line for "Outpatient Surgery" or something similar.  
  
I scanned the list of extensions and found the usual suspects: Patient Information, Emergency Quick Care, Pain Management, Outpatient Rehab Therapy, Human Resources, Cardiac Care, and Pre-Delivery Services.  
  
No such listing as "Outpatient Surgery," but I found one that should come in handy when her surgery's over and done.  
  
"Billing Injuries"  
  
Oh, wait. That would be "Billing *Inquiries*."  
  
Sometimes, try as I might, I see exactly what I believe.
