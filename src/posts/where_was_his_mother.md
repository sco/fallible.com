"*This* is how Saddam Hussein got his start!"  
  
Even I couldn't believe I'd said it. Screamed it, actually.  
  
"You're comparing me to Saddam Hussein?" asked twelve-year-old Scott, the Voice of Reason. His sense of justice was finely tuned at a young age.  
  
What *was* I saying, really? That an adolescent Saddam Hussein, like Scott, had defied his mother's authority by ignoring the time limit she'd set for Nintendo? That his propensity for invasion and conquest and brutal dictatorship all started with a joystick?  
  
What was I so afraid of?  
  
I was afraid I couldn't pull it off. Afraid I'd lose my parental edge somewhere between his puberty and his manhood, leaving him to fend for himself, to find his own way--directionless--in a world of a million ways.  
  
I was afraid of growing weary in well-doing.  
  
Scott didn't give up on me that day, though he's never forgotten my outburst. I suspect that now, with us on the very edge of war, he's thought of it more than once.  
  
I wasn't really comparing you to Saddam Hussein, Scott.  
  
I was comparing myself to his mother, and wondering just when it was she'd grown so weary.
