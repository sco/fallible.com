      Lynn--Yeah, it's for real over here! All new exterior, coming up....  
        
      D'Ann--I nearly stepped into the yard during the storm to see how it would feel to be hit by those hailstones, but I chickened out. :)  
        
      Teresa--Very pleased to meet you here. Thanks for stopping in. I will visit you, and congrats on your new grandchild!

Competition to get into a prestigious MBA institute is increasingly becoming fierce. But getting an entry into a premium Business school for pursuing MBA is not all that simple."

Dang! And, technically, ding, too!

![image](http://www.fallible.com/images/uploads/raymond1_thumb.jpg)Hail dings, that is. And lots of them. It all went down (in a rather sideways kind of way...) eight days ago and life has been a bit of a whirlwind ever since.

But our homeowners insurance company has cut us the first (but not the last) check, and the outfit who will be replacing the roof and siding on our entire house is working up their bid as we speak. I’ve seen more measuring tapes whipped out and more blueprints mulled over this past week than at any time since we built this house fifteen years ago. Whew!

Our two neighbors to the south (the only ones we’ve spoken to so far) also will be making claims, so I’m glad to find out it wasn’t just us. I’d talked to everyone in my family to see if their properties were OK, and they all replied with some variation of “What hail?”

Sometimes in life, you kind of feel like a target for crazy stuff to happen to you, and well, the stigma is more than I need right now. :) So yeah, I’m grateful we’re not completely alone!

We didn’t plan on hosting a boatload of contractors this summer and fall, but hey, we will deal. I’m going to take some before and after pics of the old homestead, too, so you can see the transformation as it takes place.

In the meantime, here are a few storm pics for your viewing pleasure. The insurance company appreciated that we’d taken these, since only our particular area in KC actually reported hail like this on that day.
