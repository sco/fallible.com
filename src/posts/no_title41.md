The girl who just checked me out at Barnes and Noble could have been my twin. Same dark hair with an auburn tint, same sprinkling of freckles, same intense blue eyes. OK, she was thirty years younger and six inches taller. Oh, yeah, and a couple of sizes skinnier. But still. I glanced at her nametag so I could thank her by name, already suspecting what I would find there. "Your first name is McKenna?" I asked. She nodded, eyes twinkling. "That's my maiden name," I said. She nodded, as if she'd known before I said anything. "I hope you've enjoyed the name as much as I have," I said. "I love it," she answered. I couldn't stop myself. I was on a roll, and we both knew it wasn't over yet. "What's your middle name?" By now, my voice was doing a little jig. "Rose." "Mine, too," I said. "And I knew just by looking at you, yours was the same." So I signed my credit slip "Kathleen Rose McKenna Raymond," picked up my new copy of "How the Irish Saved Civilization," and went on my merry way. I love it when that happens.
