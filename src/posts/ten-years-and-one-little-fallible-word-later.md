      Katy, you are inspiring and entertaining indeed.  
        
      There have been a few known personalities over the last several years who have made the bulk of their living talking about how we spend much of our time trying to look good, to hide the parts of ourselves that we don't like or are ashamed of. I think that having the name fallible, and absorbing that into who are you are and how you write, helps to get your guard down so that you can share freely about bowel movements and senile conversations without worrying what people will think. I think that if you had made any other choice, you may not have had such a good experience. I'm glad you made this selection and I'm glad you've kept at it!

Ten years ago this month, Doug and I happened upon [an article in Wired Magazine](http://www.wired.com/science/discoveries/news/1999/04/19117) that would change the course of my life.

The piece was about how few (1760, to be precise) English words remained available to those wishing to register a one-word.com domain name. The very day we read the article, [we pored over that list](http://www.wired.com/science/discoveries/news/1999/04/19116) and decided that fallible was perhaps the best one-word domain we’d EVER heard of, even if 24,000 or so other single words had already been registered.

Since then, the word *fallible* has come to define me. (Of course, my husband and children will assure you that the word applied in spades long before I registered it!) Why, I have been in a public restroom in line with dozens of women at a conference, introducing myself to the lady next to me, when all of a sudden another gal far behind in the queue (waving to [author Tammy Alexander](http://www.tameraalexander.com/)!) shouted out for all to hear, “Hey, you’re FALLIBLE!!!”

I couldn’t deny it then, and I can’t now. The opinions, outlook, values, theories, beliefs, and advice presented here are so flawed as to be laughable, and that’s when I’m not even trying to be funny. But you know what? I persist in being fallible because, well, it’s been nothing if not one of the greatest privileges of my life to be able to entertain you on this site.

And, perhaps, even to inspire you. I hope that’s the case, because there’s a dearth of genuine inspiration in the world these days. If the good Lord sees fit that I should be allowed to dispense even a bit of it, I’ll be more than satisfied.

Which, O fallible readers, is precisely why I’ve decided to turn down the offer I’ve received to buy out fallible.com for a price that’s so obscenely high that it, all by itself, would put me in the Dreaded Top Five Percent Of All Income Earners, and well, you KNOW what that means.

I don’t want to pay the tax on such an enormous income, and besides, who knows what nefarious purposes the prospective buyer of my name might have in mind? I’ve got my good reputation to protect (never mind that I was temporarily banned in the Kingdom of Bahrain for writing about, ostensibly, panties....) and would never allow fallible to fall into the clutches of disingenuous owners.

I may have to add a few paltry ads to comfort myself over the loss of this missed opportunity, though. I hope you’ll understand.
