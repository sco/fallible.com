      Ahh, the question I like to ask but can't seem to answer.  
        
      But I'm taking baby steps.  
        
      Thanks for the reminder.

      I was at a ladies function at church the other night. The speaker talked about developing a mission statement for the stage of life you're in. Then, when you're asked to volunteer or whatever, the statement can serve as a sort of sieve through which to filter the request.  
        
      So if a component of your mission statement it "to pursue opportunities to mentor little kids in learning to write," for example, and you're asked to keep score for the high school basketball season, you might come to an easier "No" answer than you would without a clear mission statement.  
        
      I, too, have a hard time saying no. But I'm getting better at it!

    text: "we talked about this at Bible study last night..i shared that i found it easier to say no to extra commitments by letting the person asking know that i have a problem with overextending myself, say i'm working hard to be better with it, and thank them for their help by not expecting me to give in to their request. oh, the relief..."

      Okay. The thing with giving out Katy's phone number is becoming epidemic!  
        
      This is a true story:  
        
      My friend who lives a couple houses up the road called me one day to confess. "I've done something horrible," she said. "I was angry that my new neighbor put up a horrible huge shed on his property, right where I see it out my kitchen window. I called her to complain, and I let her have it. Finally she asked my name. And--I'm so sorry!!--I panicked and said my name was KATY RAYMOND!"  
        
      So, Bridgie, give them all my number. And you, too, Lisa! It won't be the first time.... :)

      but you handle it all with such grace, katy...(i had a good laugh over that story :)  
        
      i don't actually have your phone # to pass around, but i know a little ex-barista from topeka who would give it to me if i asked ;)  
        
      bridget, i have a big sis, too..and although she lives across the ocean from me now, she still does a lot for me. there's nothing like a second mama!

      Ok, you people, you've taken a challenge to accomplish something, to do what God has put in your heart to do, and turned it into an opportunity to 'just say no'. Congratulations. I was feeling pretty condemned by Katy's post anyway.  
        
      I've said no before, no to some very worhwhile things, like teaching a Sunday School class. I said no and still didn't do what I felt God was wanting me to do. There's plenty of reasons. Anybody who wants to write should read a lot, so I read a lot. I read a lot more than I write. I watch TV. Just worthwhile things, you know, things that will inform me and make me a better writer.  
        
      You know what the real reason is? It's not that I can't say no. I just haven't decided. I haven't decided that God really wants me to do what I claim He has. I have decided that maybe He has.  
        
      To do what you are called to do takes more than just saying no. It takes making up your mind. I need to drive a stake into the ground that says, 'I know what I am supposed to' and I'll not go back on it, no matter what Satan whispers in my ear.  
        
      Remember the stones the chidren of Israel took out of the river bed when they crossed the Jordan? Joshua took some, too. And he built a memorial in the middle of the river. That intrigue's the heck out of me. Stones of Rememerance. There's a title for you.  
        
      PS: I thought this was going to be light and clever but it seems to have come out meaner than I expected. Take the clever and leave the mean stuff for me.

      Angus's point about not just learning to say no, but then doing the thing we intend to do, is correct.  
        
      It's like the financial teaching that if you just forego your "latte factor," you'll gain financial independence. It's true you have to say "no" to the little indulgences that are keeping you from your greater goal, but then you actually have to save and/or invest the money you didn't spend frivolously.  
        
      Maybe, to be actively intentional, for every time I say "no," I need to commit to what I'll really be doing with that time. Am I going to work on my next book with the time I would have spent in the church nursery? Or am I just saying no, but not pursuing the thing I'd rather/should be doing?  
        
      Please don't confuse me for someone who has anwers. I'm just like all the other post-modern, quasi-emergent bloggers out there. All questions, all the time... :)

      I agree absolutely, lack of commitment to one thing doesn't presuppose a commitment to any other worthwhile thing. It could just mean that I've gotten lazy as all get out as I've gotten older. :)  
      I think the "no" thing is so big because it's hard to change streams/habits/attitudes/thought processes. For me it is, anyway. And as Angus said, "I haven't decided that God really wants me to do what I claim He has. I have decided that maybe He has." That's actually much farther along than I am.  
      Some things must drop off in order to move forward in testing out whether I'm really hearing what God wants or not. The temptation is to just add on the new things and continue with all the old commitments. That way no one's expectations of me have to change. And I'm not disappointing anyone. I'm just becoming a frazzled mess. Then who has time to listen when God has something to say?  
      Right now, I'm still definitely listening and re-grouping and preparing myself with some basic background knowledge that I didn't take the time to get when I was younger. And I'm loving it! But it does take up quite a bit of time and here I am back at saying "no" once again. :)

      I used to think there was something I was missing, something waiting for me to find it, something More. But recently, I've come to realize I'm precisely where and what I'm meant to be, growing, changing, enjoying all the while. And that thing that was waiting? It was my life, patiently yet quickly passing by in hopes I would stop to notice it.  
        
      I did. And am happier for it.

      jennifer, in that i am in your boat with you, though our circumstances may be a bit different...i began answering this post of katy's with a comment about my current place in life. where i am is chock full of opportunities to give, to love, to teach and learn, to experience ups and downs and figure out how to walk with my God through them...again, i am the mother of small children. this, in effect, is my calling, my mission field, what i'm supposed to be doing. and i find that when i take on a lot of outside stuff in the interests of those outside my family or even just myself, that calling suffers. so to clarify - that is why i need to be better about saying no - i agree with the wisdom of not just denying one thing but redirecting the resources to the right thing. and i love that we can share and question and respond in bloggerland - i think it's a healthy thing.  
        
      alright, someone else's turn on the soapbox...

      Just say "oh, I have something planned already..." and leave it at that.  
        
      Then go home and take a bubblebath.  
        
      You will find yourself saying NO much more often when you attach a reward to it.

What would you be doing with your life if you didn't care what people thought of you? What is it that you really *want* to do, that you even suspect you might have been created to do?  
  
If you're already doing it, how did you get past being concerned about the opinions, wishes and criticisms of others?  
  
Hey, my dad's been dead twenty years, and I'm still trying to please him. Although I'm *starting* to think that if the straight A's didn't do it ("Why aren't these A+s?"), it ain't gonna happen.  
  
Put another way, what are you doing with your life, because of the expectations of others, that you'd rather *not* be doing?  
  
Either way, is there a small step you can take today to move you closer to what you envision for your life?  
  
Life is short, you know, and getting shorter all the time.
