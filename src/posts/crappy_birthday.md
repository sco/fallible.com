      happy birthday, Mr. Raymond!  
      hope the gifts are better than the card.

"I'm pathetic," I told Scott. "I picked up the first birthday card I saw, and bought it."  
  
Today is my husband Doug's Big-Five-One, and I'm off my game. What can I say? Some years, it happens. I usually choose beautiful, romantic cards with grainy photographs of guitars and lace and brass beds with rumpled linens, but not this time.  
  
It's not Doug's fault, of course, and I guess it's not mine, either. It's just life.  
  
I read Scott the text of the card, and I could discern his inward groaning through the phone.  
  
"*So*," he said, a little cautiously, "you just grabbed the card with the sports car on it, and that was it?"  
  
"Worse," I admitted. "I grabbed the bright green one with the gold glitter dollar sign in place of the letter S."  
  
"Whoa," Scott said, and with that, I knew he understood everything I'm going through.  
  
And, I must say, so does Doug.
