![Smoking or Non?](http://www.fallible.com/restaurant.jpg)The Cheesecake Factory on the Plaza in Kansas City had just opened for lunch. I mean, my girlfriend and I were the *very first* customers to be ushered into the vast upstairs dining room.  
  
"Smoking, non-smoking, or first available?" the hostess asked.  
  
I slowly looked around for signs of life and found none. She waited, menus in hand, but seemed a tad impatient with my indecisiveness.  
  
"Well," I said to the young woman, careful to look her right in the eye, and trying to be diplomatic. "Aren't they *all* available?"  
  
She looked at me, unblinking, not getting it. She was a lovely girl, really, but...it's sad, isn't it?  
  
I would never be so insensitive as to mention this here, had the *exact* same thing not happened six months earlier, in the same spot, with a different hostess.  
  
One thing's certain. The employee training sure is consistent.
