    text: "katy, yes, it was more intellectually challenging than your typical youth group fare. i think there were an equal number of people who enjoyed the mental stimulation as those who felt it was over their heads. ah well. it was good to have something for once not aimed at the teen \"hot topics\" of drugs/sex/rock and roll/parents/peer pressure. :)"

    text: "No - I had already been overseas and back when I read it. <br><br>The idea that stuck with me from the book is that our primary calling is NOT our vocation - i.e. businessman, teacher, doctor, mother, etc. but that our primary calling is to follow Jesus. That journey of following him is just that - a journey. It's dynamic, not static, and as you follow him your \"secondary\" (i.e. vocational, etc.) callings can change over the years.<br><br>Anyway, that's the gist of what I understood from the book."

    text: "Bethany, I heard him speak on Sunday, and he was a bit over my head, too. Not that I didn't completely understand what he was saying, just that I'd never thought a lot of it myself, so I had to pay attention. No zoning out allowed!<br><br>Ellen, Yes. That's the message I'm getting, too. And it is a distinction that other teachers on the subject of \"calling\" don't make. (the one between primary calling--in response to God--and secondary calling--choosing a vocation as a result of the primary calling. Such a crucial distinction!"

    text: "Bridgie, Same Guinness family, from what I understand. JV met the man at a luncheon last week, and he named the county in Ireland his people are from, but he was actually born in China to medical missionaries. Educated at Oxford, so speaks with a decided British accent, not Irish."

    text: "Os Guinness is a wonderful speaker and teacher, he not only offers incredibly well-studied insights about history and society, he's also offered much freedom for people all over to follow Christ, and to live according to their individual \"calling\", in a way that is liberating and with vitality.. the glory of God is a person fully alive!"

![Os Guinness - The Call](http://www.fallible.com/thecall.jpg)If you ever get the opportunity to hear Os Guinness speak in person, take it. Each word in every sentence is like a piece of a poem--so precisely chosen as to gleam in its apparent effortlessness. A thirty minute presentation delivers more meaning than many people express in a lifetime.  
  
Until you get the chance, I recommend you read "Long Journey Home" and "The Call." I've only just begun them myself, but my intention is to end up with a changed life.  
  
I love it when that happens.
