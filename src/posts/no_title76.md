My father named me Katy because, he said, I had a face like the map of Ireland. The map has lost a landmark, somehow. A point of beauty up in the north country, very near the eyes, has changed. If you look closely, though, you will see a small light shining there, bright and beckoning, forever. The map grows old, and fades. But still I hope, when you see it, it leads you true north, to her.
