    text: "Wow, Lisa. I never thought about how hard it would be for a night woman to be on her kids' schedule! Bad enough for a day woman to raise a night boy (Sco). Can't imagine the other way around! Try sleeping in a poet's gown to wake up crisp, refreshed, and poetic. (Ha.)"

Is it just me, or is anyone else suddenly smitten with blue and white woven cotton nightdresses, preferably with embroidered flowers on the bodice? I have purchased two now--one sleeveless and one with long poet's sleeves. Wearing them is pure inspiration. If it's just me, though, I'm OK with that.
