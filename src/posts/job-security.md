You started out a two-bit thief,  
Sleeping through the sun-drenched days, lazy and unmotivated.  
You only came out at night, back then, sneaking around  
Gaining entrance through carelessly unlocked windows, helping Yourself  
To the old woman’s unimportant memorabilia.

Then you stepped it up a notch,  
Breaking and entering through bolted and chained doors,  
You disabled her alarm system over and over again.  
Stealing more valuable possessions every time you cased her joint,  
Terrorizing her with anger, confusion, fear,  
Taking everything, except the knowledge that you’d return.

Now she hears the final frightening footfall,  
Your brazen steps storming through what’s left of her mind.  
She can no longer name another living soul,  
Only you.  
Dementia, what a Master Thief you’ve at last become.
