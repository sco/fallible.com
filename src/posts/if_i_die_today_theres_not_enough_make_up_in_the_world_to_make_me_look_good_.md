      Maybe it's the dark mood but for some reason the comments are hard for me to read this morning unless I highlight them.  
        
      I had a grueling emotional week as well...I'm beginning to think we're like some twins seperated at birth or betazoids or whatever the heck those folks were on Star Trek - The slightly better actor generation.. We seem to travel the same emotional paths albeit for different reasons.  
        
      It wasn't Paul who said that ...well he may have but he was quoting someone else .. Jesus.  
        
      "I have much more to say to you, more than you can now bear." John 16:12  
        
      Jesus was telling us we learn in stages. I'm not great at quoting the bible, but I know that verse intimately because it resonates with me everyday....the good days, and the bad ones.  
        
      Bless you and yours,

      I could have swore I posted this...but may be I didn't hit the post button...if it shows up twice blame it on ...well blame it on me ...looking around there doesn't seem to be any other target.  
        
      First off...maybe its the dark mood, but am I the only one having a hard time reading the comments...the font and background color seem to have changed I have to highlight them to read them.  
        
      Second I'm beginning to think you and I are distant cousins or twins seperated at birth or beta-zerts or whatever they called those emotion sensing souls on "Star Trek-The Slightly Better Actor Generation"...  
        
      It's been an emotional week for me too and I feel for your pain...  
        
      I forget what else I said when I posted this originally or thought I did, except that it wasn't Paul who said that...well he may have, but he was quoting someone else....Jesus..  
        
      "I have much more to say to you, more than you can now bear." John 16:12  
        
      Jesus tells us we learn in stages, how true...what He didn't tell us - at least in my case - is that oftentimes its because we refused to learn the first time :)  
        
      Things will get better. I had a crappy day or two this week too..  
        
      You're in our prayers.

      Hi katy,  
      I totally agree with your posted title.  
      I have to say that you have the essence of life.  
      But, one thing I want to say or share that as per my point of view it's good if we are trying to looking good until we will die.

You probably think the title of this post sounds like something my mom would say but, uh, it came out of my own mouth.  
  
That's right. At three this afternoon, after spending almost the entire day in bed attempting to recover from one of the most grueling, exhausting, and emotionally bizarre weeks I've ever endured, I heard myself utter these words.  
  
The words aren't much, but they're all I've got, so they'll have to do for now.  
  
Wasn't it St. Paul who wrote in one of his epistles, "I have many more things to say to you, but you cannot bear them now"?  
  
Well, you people are amazing. You could bear my words just fine, I'm sure. But my fingers have forgotten how to type, my mind how to formulate coherent thoughts, and my eyes how to focus on anything but the insides of my closed eyelids.  
  
I will blog again, and soon, I promise. In the meantime, a grateful smile has crossed my lips just thinking about my wonderful readers who have become my friends.  
  
And I wanted to say Thanks.  
  
Also, if there are any actors out there who could part with a generous quantity of take-no-prisoners theater make-up, my face just might be the worthy cause you've been looking for.
