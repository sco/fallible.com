We've waited a long time for the special delivery that will be arriving tomorrow. We've planned for this day, and saved, and invested. We've set aside resources in anticipation of the big event far beyond those we've delegated to equally momentous occasions. Sacrifices were made. We've accumulated odds and ends to get ready for the new arrival, not to mention warehousing garage sale furniture, accessories, end-of-season hats, gloves, sleepers, blankets, white-sale linens, and bric-a-brac. We have a couple of cribs, a baby swing, a trike and a big-wheel, a scooter and six or seven lunch boxes. There's a tooth fairy pillow, bumper pads, and even a few jars of baby food and a container of powdered formula. But, tomorrow! Ah, tomorrow, the special delivery of a lifetime, the one we've waited for until way overdue. Finally, a dumpster.
