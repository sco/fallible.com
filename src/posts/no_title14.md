The trees are bare now, outside this window of mine, the fields blanketed in a variagated yarn of gold, russet, red and purple. I spotted an errant piece of green grass just now, like the verdant lap of a needleworker whose afghan has a hole in it, and wondered how the knitter slipped that stitch. Out of no where, from no tree at all, a solitary gilded leaf falls onto the green, completing the creator's handiwork.
