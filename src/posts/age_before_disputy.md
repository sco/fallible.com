Names and numbers are not her thing....Did I mention she called me Debbie (the other girl Doug was engaged to) for the first 5 years we were married? I can say these things, even in a public forum like this, because of the large love she and I share. :)"

Doug's mother and I sat next to each other at Thanksgiving, so that we could read each other's lips at close range, I guess. Sheesh.  
  
Part way through dinner, the subject between the two of us switched to holiday gift-giving. (My sister-in-law's fiber-optic tree had worked its magic.)  
  
"All I want for Christmas," my mother-in-law said in certain terms, "is a picture of the three of you."  
  
I did a quick mental head count before responding.  
  
"Which three?"  
  
We had a meeting of the eyes, if not the minds. I stared into her face, and saw the intent deepen in her jaw line as her brow furrowed. I concentrated on her lips, determined not to misunderstand her forthcoming reply.  
  
"You, Doug, and the kids."  
  
Alrighty, then.
