My earlier blog on "Relevant Church Names" has not resulted in a formal church name generator, but I'm OK with that. It has, however, resulted in tons of discussion off-site, including at my young friend Hanna's college graduation party the other night.  
  
Her friend, Paul, a philosophy major, opined over hors d'eovres that if he were naming, he'd choose "Pilate's Sink." I like it a lot, but got to wondering later if maybe Paul's hands were sticky when it occurred to him.  
  
Scott says he found a church called "Levi's Table," and, scriptural literates though we are, we just don't get it. Doesn't it sound kind of like the type of operation Jesus might have overturned in the temple in a righteous fit of anger?  
  
I had a sore toe last week, which put me in the mind of "Magdalene's Ointment," but is that a good way to pick a church name?  
  
Doug made himself Cream of Wheat this morning, and I couldn't help but think about how tragic it would be if he traded his birthright for a mess of it, and thus emerged "Esau's Pottage."  
  
Getting ready for a McKenna Christmas Feast at our house has got me cooking up names with a culinary twist. Off the top of my head, the best I've come up with so far is "Herod's Platter."  
  
Just be thankful I'm not in the ministry.
