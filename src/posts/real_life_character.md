      I don't have a character to share, I am the character.  
        
      No toe ring, no sandles but ...

The old guy standing at the service counter in Best Buy looked for all the world like he'd just driven a truck load of pigs down from Maryville, Missouri to the slaughterhouse near the old stockyards in Kansas City.  
  
(Something tells me the stockyards aren't there anymore, but they were when I was a kid, back when my siblings and I found out we'd been feasting upon Claudia and Mary Jo--the pet cows my Grandpa slaughtered when his health gave way--for dinner.)  
  
I wondered, as I stood in line behind his short and stocky overalled frame, whether a fellow like him used a computer in his line of work. From the looks of his early-Spring farmer's tan, he didn't spend a lot of time indoors. His balding head rarely met the light of day, though, if its pale demeanor when he removed his cap to mop off the sweat was any indication.  
  
Tiny tufts of greying hair sprouted from a few random spots on his freckled scalp, and the way they frizzed made me think he'd probably had a full head of curly hair as a younger man. When he turned his head partway to the side, I got an eyeful of eyebrows like the ones Andy Rooney sports. Some of those puppies were so long, I expected him to jump back and yell "Ouch!" when they poked him in the eye.  
  
From where I stood, the only thing young about this geezer was the fact that he wore sandals instead of manure-encrusted boots. I took a whiff of him, and didn't smell any traces of manure at all, but I did pick up the aroma of Lava soap--the kind hard-working men use to charm the grime from underneath their fingernails.  
  
Another clerk stepped up behind the counter and beckoned me to meet him there. The old farmer spoke, but I didn't quite hear what he said, since he was on my deaf side. The only way I could hear him--or even know for sure whether he was speaking to me--was to turn and face him head on.  
  
He asked me a question about the DVD-Rs I was about to purchase, wanting to make sure I knew what I was getting myself into, since he was stuck in that durned line returning a batch of the same kind that hadn't been right for his machine.  
  
At least, I think that's what he said. I mumbled some non-techie reply, mesmerized by the sight of his left ear lobe, which hosted not only one hoop earring but also three additional studs of various jewel tones.  
  
I finished my business, but before I turned to walk away I couldn't resist hazarding another peek at his feet.  
  
Just as I suspected: a gold toe ring.  
  
Sometimes, it pays to look a man full in the face--and full in the feet, too--before you set to thinking you know just what kind of a man he is. One good look, and you're likely to be left wondering about him for quite a spell afterwards.  
  
Any interesting characters you've run into lately?
