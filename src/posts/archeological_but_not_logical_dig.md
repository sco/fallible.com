      And how CAN I resist chiming in when I know that you have had all of those UNUSED bath and hand towels sitting in your linen closet for most of my 22 years?

    text: "I'm all about lip balm. Tubes, canisters, whatever. I like to keep some in every room of the house, every coat pocket, every purse and bag. Chapped lips are a drag, and heaven forbid I would have them remain chapped for more than five seconds. I can also understand the necessity of having lots of tweezers. You never know when a stray chin hair or splinter will present itself. Best to be prepared."

I cart a box back to my parents' house every time I visit just because I don't have room to keep them at my place. I need a larger apartment. Heck, I need a dedicated multi-room library. I suppose I take after my dad in that...."

I can't make myself throw either away because both may come in useful someday. Actually I have lots of pieces of paper with all kinds of notes and scribbled stuff on 'em. I'm afraid to throw anything away coz that could've been the germ of the novel that was to make me famous! Just kidding ;)"

She had been a beautifican when VERY young but had not left her house in many years. There were all sorts of hair stuff she never owuld have used herself. It's like she ran an imaginary salon or something. Some items were brand new. She had ordered them or had her hubby pick them up."

It's great fun...well, a little fun, anyway :)"

      You guys will be the bane of your childrens' existence! Of the things mentioned here, I also collect leftover paper plates and cups from birthday parties (too bad Cabbage Patch kids aren't the rage), every personal letter and card I've ever received, YARN (Oh, yeah, Kelly...), love letters, UNOPENED BILLS (eeeewww) and hair dye (love the story, Heather.). I quit coloring my hair five years ago (after a 30 year habit), and haven't gotten rid of a dozen boxes of dye yet. ;)  
        
      I forgot to mention my MIL's other fetish, which no one here admits to. Shoe laces-----at least a hundred new pairs of shoe laces, all colors and lengths. I don't know about you, but I rarely break a shoe lace. With my family of five, perhaps a total of five have ever needed to be replaced. So what's up with that, do you think, for an 82 year old lady?  
        
      Thanks for the laughs, you guys. You're great!

      Bethany, You are a daring girl! A bra extender hooks onto the back of a bra, adding a couple inches around, for a lady who's gained a little weight, or whose bra shrunk in the dryer. ;)  
        
      Steph, I'm hanging onto Cabbage Patch for now! And Transformers, and Strawberry Shortcake and Scooby Do, too. But I'll keep you in mind! :)  
        
      Lisa, Kev goes for any party I throw. He's easy to please.....

Someday, years from now let's hope, your kids (many of them yet unborn) will excavate your home, weed through your possessions, and probably trash most of what you've accumulated.  
  
Question: Is there a certain item your poor, unsuspecting children will discover copious amounts of? What is it and why do you have so flippin' MUCH OF IT?????  
  
With my mother, it was manicure scissors and tweezers. Scores of each. Also thousands upon thousands of pencils and pens that didn't write. Also unbelievable amounts of what she called "scratch paper." In essence, office supplies.  
  
For Doug's mother, whose house we are currently clean sweeping, it's ziploc bags, baggies, foil, wax paper, and cleaning supplies. (She's never been much for cleaning.) Also, HUNDREDS of those little purse-sized containers of Kleenex brand facial tissues. (I've never heard the woman sneeze.) Also, thousands of S&H green stamps. Really. A gazillion tiny bars of hotel soap, and she hasn't been out of town for ten years. And at least a dozen bra extenders. (I'm sorry, I know I committed two entries down to not writing about underwear, but stuff happens.)  
  
What about you? When your descendents dig you out, what will they think of the civilization you've built?  
  
I won't tell you mine just yet, but I have a feeling my kids might chime in here.
