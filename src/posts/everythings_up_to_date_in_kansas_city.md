      Blogs being out of style is cool with me.  
      I've never been one to be on the forefront of trend setting.  
      If it were trendy I would feel uncomfortable.  
        
      Your mom is a hoot.  
        
      Take Care

Blogs were out of style like last week or something (the turnover is very high with them). Anyway, that is how I view it. So, maybe your mom is right in a sense. Or maybe she's a little crazy. Aren't we all?"

      Katy,  
        
      I keep wanting to catch your updates on the same days they're posted, but for some reason I'm always at least a day behind.  
        
      I just wanted to say thank you for, and update you on the status of, your former dice coffee mug. I had intended to send you a thank-you card at least, but I am not sure where I put that return address.  
        
      The status of the mug...  
      I was unable to dispose of the mug in explosive or otherwise destructive fashion, mostly due to the fact that Bianca (my girlfriend) loves it. We have six mugs now, and she won't use any of the others for coffee or hot chocolate.  
        
      So I guess you can rest easy, knowing that it hasn't gone to waste.  
        
      Thanks, Katy :)

      PS - About blogging: if it is out of date, please continue lagging behind the trend. I am not the only one who likes your blog.

      I forgot something.  
        
      If you're interested, one of these days I'm sure I will be in posession of mugs for the sole purpose of being demolished. I can send you, or link you to, film/images of said destruction.  
        
      Keep me posted.

My mom comes up with stuff, a lot of stuff, that bears repeating. She did it again this morning.  
  
"Mom," I said, "that's just too funny. I'm going to have to blog it."  
  
"No, don't," she said. "You can't blog that."  
  
I thought for a second that perhaps her sense of decorum or modesty was kicking in. I should have known better.  
  
"Why not?"  
  
"Because blogs are out of style."  
  
So, after all the years I've spent in therapy to recover from the bad pixy cuts, the rubberized grey snow pants I was forced to wear if the weatherman forecast flurries, and the clod-hopping saddle oxfords I trudged around in when the whole world had gone to classic penny loafers, I learn that Mom's chief concern in life is that I be in style.  
  
"How do you know blogs have fallen from fashion?" I asked.  
  
"You never see them anymore."  
  
"Anymore? What do you mean? You've never seen a blog in your life."  
  
Which, of course, is the reason I can write with impunity about the dear woman here at fallible.com.  
  
"Sure I have. I saw you in the Kansas City Star, didn't I?"  
  
She had me there.  
  
"But, Mom, that wasn't a blog, per se. That was just an article about blogging...There's a difference."  
  
"Mark my words, it's out of style."  
  
"How do you know?"  
  
"I haven't seen an article about you since that one last Spring. Blogging's as outdated as an old Monkey Wards catalog."  
  
Once my mother gets an idea firmly planted in her mind, she doesn't delay in spreading her version of the truth far and wide. She wouldn't hesitate, if she thought something was newsworthy--like the untimely demise of blogging--to call My Brother The BigWig Executive At The Local NBC Affilate and offer him the poop and the scoop.  
  
For my own sake, for the sake of NBC's reputation, and for the sake of the entire blogosphere, I'm going to have to turn this around, and fast.  
  
If any editors, agents, or publishers are lurking and would like to save the institution of blogging for future generations, drop me a line. I've got a couple of book proposals and a completed novel I'd love to talk to you about.  
  
I'm thinking if I don't get published in print again soon, Mom just might ruin this blogging thing for all of us.
