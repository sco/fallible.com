      D'Ann--I am rarely anyone's hero, so you have given me tremendous joy. :)  
        
      Just so you know, you and your hubby are in the minority. The girl who closed our refi told us that only ONE % of all who refi SHORTEN THEIR TERM. Most go all the way back out to 30 (or more) years, and most of those cash out. All I have to say about that is: STOP THE INSANITY!!! :) Big congrats to you for getting on the 15-year track. You will be shocked at how much your principal will be reduced every month, compared to the lack-of-progress with the 30-year!

    text: "Yes, I would say that you, and hubby and I, are in the minority. We built our home in OK, lots of blood and sweat and paying as we went along. By the time we moved in, we had a small mortgage to finish, paid in five years. We lived mortgage free for years. Ah, but now we are moving closer to son, our final home, we hope. We mortgaged the paid home to buy this one! Feels very strange, but when we sell the OK, we will again be mortgage free. We generally only buy what we can pay for. Praise God for His blessings."

      People usually go to an astrologer to know the reason for their unsolved problems and worries. The astrologer will tell some slogans and tell to do some remedies like visiting temples etc. As the time passes, some of the problems will automatically be solved and believer will think that, it is because of God's grace.  
      On the other hand, when a believer is happy and there is no problem to solve, why he is not thinking about God's grace and go to an astrologer to find the reason for his happiness?

It’s true. I am a sucker for a guy who talks refi with me.

Actually, I usually bring up the subject. It’s part of our division of labor, I guess. Doug’s activities are weighted a bit more heavily on the income side, and mine tend to concentrate around how to divvy up the income and, always, how to continue finding and implementing the most effective cost-cutting measures. Between the two of us, we get the job done, and isn’t that what marriage is all about?

We built this house nearly 15 years ago, and at the time we took out a 30-year loan. These days, with Doug being nearly 57 years old and with me being the age that I am (Ha!), I would not be comfortable taking out a 30-year loan, or even a 15-year loan.

In fact, I remember my father, gone lo these 25 years, talking about a friend of the family who, at age 65, took out a 30-year mortgage.

“He’s retiring next year!” Dad said. “You’re supposed to have burned your mortgage *years* before you retire.”

My dad wasn’t just blowing smoke. He and Mom purchased their third and final home when I was six years old. By the time I, their oldest child, graduated from high school, they had paid off the house. They’d taken out a 20-year loan, and in 11 years, that puppy was history.

I’ll admit I’ve never gotten in the habit of making extra payments to my principal. But we have refinanced several times since our first mortgage on this house, which was at 8.25%. And each time, we’ve decreased the term of the loan as well as the rate.

When we closed on this refi last week, we signed paperwork for a 10-year loan at 4.625%. We had 11 years left on our previous 15-year loan, which was at 5.875%. That doesn’t sound like it would change our financial picture too much, but it really does.

If we were to take 10 full years to pay off this house (which we won’t, because the remaining mortgage is so small...), not only would we have one full year at the end without payments, but we would have saved nearly $50,000 besides! Yes, our house payment just went down a cool $400 per month.

I’m a believer in cutting small expenses where it makes sense, but sometimes those big ones can be trimmed without too terribly much effort and the return on your investment of a few hours time can be tremendous.

One day in the not-too-distant future, I plan to host an Old-Fashioned Mortgage Burning Party with the man of my dreams.

Call me my father’s daughter, but I can’t imagine anything better.
