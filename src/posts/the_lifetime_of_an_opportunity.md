Hey, everybody! I've been nominated (okay, by Doug, but still...) to win a 2004 Weblog Award, in the highly prestigious category of "Best of the Top 1000-1750 Blogs." The category any given blog falls into is determined by how many other blogs link to it. Since fallible has about 100 blogs linking to it, this is where I belong.  
  
If you'd like to see me move up the scale of nominees, I'd not only appreciate it, but I'd also get a huge kick out of it.

You people are the best...
