I sit down in the brown velvet chair at Starbuck's, turn on my portable keyboard, and wait for...what? Within a minute or two, a man sits on the couch opposite me, clutching his coffee, not looking me in the eye. He plants himself firmly in the remotest corner of the couch, feet squarely set on the floor, and looks beyond me, out the window. He is forty or so, with huge glasses, enormously clunky black tie-up boots, and a pocket protector. His jacket and billed cap display a Pepsi logo, and I glance into the parking lot to confirm he is a truck driver. Another couple minutes go by, and a woman joins him, dressed identically, only with earrings. They are trucking partners, here for the first time, pop drinkers in a coffee drinking world. She sits down a little left of center, a little closer to his side of the couch than he might have liked, and I picture each of them at home in bed with their own spouses, the men hugging the edge of the beds, and the women hugging the men. They both wear wedding rings, but not each other's. "This is pretty good," she says, as if she's never tasted coffee, or maybe has had her doubts whether there could be anything virtuous about such an expensive beverage. The man clutches his coffee close to the vest, never putting it on the little table they might have shared, never letting himself get too comfortable. The woman is a little stiff herself, at first, but loosens up rapidly. Soon, she is leaning on one elbow, head hanging back, legs crossed femininely and in striking contrast to her costume, sprawled over 2/3 of the couch, stroking the velvet as she sips. She is laughing easily at everything her partner says. He isn't a funny man, that's the thing, but he is friendly. He looks straight ahead when he talks, but she turns to look right in his face when she responds. *He's afraid of falling for her*, I think. *And she's already fallen for him...* I'm thinking her husband never makes her laugh like this. Not only is her husband not funny, he's not even friendly. The trucker, on the other hand, is sincere, honest, droll, a good man. He is not trying to entertain her, but she is more than entertained--she is relaxed and happy. And he's starting to realize it. He's only had this effect on one woman in his life, and when it happened, he married her before she could form a second impression. Now he can't believe it's happening again--lightening isn't supposed to strike in the same man twice. She takes her jacket off and throws it to the side, settling in, as acclimated now to these surroundings as if she spent every lunch break here. Over the speakers comes the tune, "I am a man of constant sorrows..." and she says, "I don't like this song." "You don't?" he asks, and then he makes some comment that has her laughing so hard she's punching him on the arm. He doesn't move, just holds his coffee a little closer to his heart, and wonders. By now, she's sitting on the edge of the couch, closer to him, and leaning into him as she speaks. He still faces forward. Finally, she looks at her watch and says, "All right, let's go." Before she can grab her coat and purse, he jumps up and makes a run for the door, eager for the relative safety of the truck. Seldom have I seen a man more frightened, or more in awe of his own astonishing charisma.
