![mark-up](http://www.fallible.com/markup2.gif)I hit send last night to email my marked-up version of the full-length novel I was hired to edit two weeks ago. (Let this serve as my excuse for my dearth of blogging!)  
  
Wow! What a great experience this has been. The story is good--really good--and this first-time novelist is to be commended for his imagination, skillful handling of dialogue, and competent plot construction. All he needed was a good editor, which is exactly what every writer needs. I hope I've been that for him.  
  
In the process, I've realized I'm a fairly competent writer, too, and that I'd better be about it. As usual, time's a wastin'.  
  
When you're almost fifty, it wastes a lot faster than it used to.
