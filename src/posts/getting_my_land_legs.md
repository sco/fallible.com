      Glad you're back safely! You'll be surprised when you see the "summer version" of your son. :)

      Tim, OMG, what has he done? The last I saw him, he was growing a beard, which I like....  
        
      Bridgie, You'll cruise again, little sister. Tomorrow, it's back in the saddle for me. I'm going to try to help Mom find all her docs to get her taxes done. She swears she's lost everything!

      It's like on Friends, where Phoebe never goes to the dentist, because every time she does, someone dies.  
        
      Glad you had fun! :)

      Each summer when we go on vacation ( a gathering of all the clan in small house on Lake Erie) there seems to a string of celebrity deaths. It's gotten to be a tradition for the early risers who've already read the newspaper to greet family members stumbling down the stairs looking for that first cup of coffee with the phrase "Guess who's dead?"  
        
      That probably speaks more to the lack of entertainment at our vacation destination than anything else I suppose :)

      Michael--This is a phenomenon with us, as well! My cousins and their hubbies visited from Scotland two years ago, and stayed with us for two weeks. They'd watch CNN early in the morning, and report over coffee which leaders in England had happened to drop dead overnight. As I recall, they weren't unhappy with the various demises!!  
        
      Brooke--We had such a good time! Missed you, though, and want to get together ASAP. Speaking of shaving, I had never seen Doug's naked face until we'd been married about 18 years. The beard came and went, but he always had a mustache until then. It's always a bit of a shock, but a fun one. Shaven or unshaven, Doug's the man for me!

    text: "Lisa--The great thing (for me) was that they always had a couple of sugar-free desserts, so I could stick with my regimen. After 4+ years without sugar, the eating of eat would make me ill, so it was fun to have SF choices! (And of course, sunsets are always sugar-free!)"

I've got my sea legs, baby.  
  
Doug and I just spent a week on the Norwegian Sky, the first time we've gotten away in two years. It was fabulous. We did Puerto Rico, St. Thomas, St. Maarten's, Antigua, Tortola, Martinique, and in our spare time, a couple of poolside chaises.  
  
Not counting the Puerto Rican rain forest and the every-afternoon-dessert-buffet, my very favorite thing was that while we were gone, no one died. (OK, I guess, technically, the head of Hamas died, but I can hardly be held even remotely responsible for him.)  
  
You would have to know the sordid history of me and vacation to understand my relief, and I will spare you the sorry details. Suffice it to say that an entire week passed without terrible incident on the home front, and I am grateful and more than a bit amazed.  
  
Now if I could just get my land legs back.....
