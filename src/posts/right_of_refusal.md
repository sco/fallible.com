      This statement: "I'm the type that holds myself personally responsible for everyone and their mother's papercuts..." HA!  
        
      But speaking of cuts, Dr. Laura sure knows how to 'cut to the chase' now, doesn't she?

"Wait a minute. Doesn't your religion teach redemption?"  
  
OK, those weren't Dr. Laura's exact words. I was driving while listening, and trying out stubby pencils and sun-dried pens at every stop light so I could get down the gist of it. So this is a paraphrase, and a pretty darned good one, I'm thinking.  
  
The man had called in to say he was having trouble committing to a woman, though he really wanted to.  
  
"Never mind what you say you want. Why aren't you committing?"  
  
The guy explained that when he was eleven, a fifteen-year-old boy sexually abused him. More than once. And that he'd never told his parents or anyone, and he wasn't sure why he'd kept the secret. At any rate, the memories made him feel terrible about himself, so bad in fact that it was keeping him from a healthy relationship with a woman.  
  
"You were old enough to know what was happening wasn't right?"  
  
"Yes."  
  
"But you also knew that the older boy had the power in the situation."  
  
"Yes."  
  
"But you also knew that you should have told your parents, and for whatever reason, you didn't."  
  
"That's right."  
  
"You know what? It's against your religion to refuse redemption. All that stuff is in the past. You're a man now. It's over. For you to hold onto things that happened in the past is to turn away from the very redemption you claim to believe in."  
  
I know this is weird, but I'd never thought of it like that. I'm the type that holds myself personally responsible for everyone and their mother's papercuts, not to mention my actual sins of omission and commission, which are legion.  
  
"Hey, wait a minute. Isn't it against your religion to refuse redemption?"  
  
Yeah. As a matter of fact, I think it is...
