    text: "I just read this and don't really have a good this or that...it just reminded me of a book I read a year or two ago about a young boy who goes on a quest. On the way he sojourns with a shop-keeper who actually likes the idea of a quest more than a quest and so never leaves. Thus, he cannot be disappointed. He haunts me. The book is called \"The Alchemist\" by Paulo Coehlo."

The caller to Dr. Laura had been living with her boyfriend for two years, and had found out through several people that he referred to her as his "friend from work." She was devastated.  
  
"He doesn't think of you as a keeper," Dr. Laura said. "Why don't you leave him?"  
  
"I'm scared to be without him," the caller said. "I'm scared to start over."  
  
"Would you rather be permanently used or temporarily scared?"  
  
This got me thinking about similar exchanges a person might be asked to weigh.  
  
For instance, seven or eight years ago, I had several book proposals considered by publishers, and then had them subsequently fall through the cracks. The proposals, not the publishers. My ideas weren't formally rejected or completely accepted; rather, they were positively appraised before becoming irretrievably lost.  
  
This process made me feel oddly invisible, a feeling I hesitate to reproduce by submitting my current book ideas to publishers today.  
  
"Would you rather be permanently unpublished or temporarily invisible?"  
  
I really hate invisible, but it's got to hurt less than unpublished, so that's my choice.  
  
How about you? How would you fill in the blanks after the words *permanently* and *temporarily*?
