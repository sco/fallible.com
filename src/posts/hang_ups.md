      Like that song says: Don't stop till you get enough. Although it may be a bad thing that Michael Jackson sang it. :)

    text: "mine may well be the idea that the \"thump, thump\" of one's heartbeat is intended to remind us of the two words RIGHT NOW - as in, right now is all we really have, all we can somewhat control our responses in, all we can be sure of what's happening in. as in the past and the future are spiraling away from us, and the only thing in focus is what's right now. and i'm adding to that what i heard an earnest college student say in church last sunday in snowy michigan - the reminder of Jesus to \"remain in me\". remaining in Jesus right now...my new years words to live by. God give me grace..."

    text: "Ivy--Well, Michael can't get all the credit for everything he's ever sung, right? Good motto.<br><br>Bridget--And I've seen you in action on this one. It's admirable!<br><br>Sara--I'm a big fan of cliches. And cliques, too, now that I'm seeing how they look in print. (Not a fan of plaques or plagues, though.) And I for one am much stronger than I used to be, so your cliche is a good one.<br><br>Lisa--Yes. \"Remain in Me\" is so in the moment, isn't it? Just like \"Right Now\" is. I will remember these as well. They remind of a book I haven't seen but have read about, \"The Power of Now.\"<br><br>Another motto I like is, \"The truth will set you free, but first it's really going to tick you off.\" Maybe I have issues...."

Two mottos I've chosen for 2003:  
  
"Don't believe everything you think."  
  
"Oh, no! Not *another* freakin' learning experience!"  
  
Do you have a favorite?
