      Heh. In my family we have a joke about "cutting every third word" - it stems from a long ago history paper I wrote where I needed to bring my word count down. My mathematically-minded father and sister decided that cutting every third word would work the best, while my writer/editor-mother sharpened her best red pencil... In the end we did end up reducing it by a third! <br><br>Now it's just a family joke. :)

    text: "Ellen--It's hilarious to think that the mathematician's method and the editor's method might have equally successful results!<br><br>Maria--Oh, when I write I'm not Hemingway--only when I edit someone else's writing!!<br><br>Irene--You will get better at whacking your own words with age and practice. When you have kids, you realize what little real impact most of your (careless) words have!!<br><br>Owen--Thanks for visiting! I will follow your website, too.<br>"

![Holey Bible](http://www.fallible.com/img/thumbnails/holeybible.jpg)"Now to Him who is able to do exceedingly abundantly above all that we ask or think..."  
  
It's Sunday at Great Plains Community Church, Pastor Tom is reading one of his favorite Scriptures, and I'm ticking off the syllables.  
  
"I would have cut ten words," I whisper to Doug.  
  
"What are you saying?" he asks.  
  
I'm nearly finished editing a 500-page novel, the second one this spring. I now red-line myself when I speak too floridly, and edit the dialog in my dreams.  
  
"I would have changed it to, 'Now to Him who can do anything."  
  
Don't worry. I'll stick to novels.
