    text: "Ellen, Your Mama, the Editor. And your Daddy, the Mathematician. You have had a hard life, little one. No one should have to endure one of each! Tee, hee.<br><br>Lisa, I remember being jealous of a rich lady I went to church with, whose children were all grown. She had a housekeeper (full time) and a gardener and a cook, and spent her time in Bible study. I was so jealous! \"I could be spiritual, too, if I had a free minute!\" I've got more free minutes now, of course, and I'm not as angry at this lady as I used to be. It's the whole circle of life thing, I guess. It also helps, when assessing someone like Oscar Wilde, to tell yourself, \"OK, that was his JOB. Moving a comma in the morning, and one in the afternoon. That's what we paid him to do.\" Weird, huh? But I'm getting to be OK with it."

A good reason to only write half the day:  
  
"I was working on the proof of one of my poems all the morning, and I took out a comma. In the afternoon I put it back again." Oscar Wilde
