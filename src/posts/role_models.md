![I Want...I mean...I Do.](http://www.fallible.com/img/justmarried.jpg)"Joel wants Jennifer to stay home and raise the children," said the young blonde in the black boots and short skirt. She lifted her latte to her lips and sipped.  
  
"When are they getting married?" asked the other woman, in the belted pink sweater and gray slacks.  
  
"July. And Jennifer doesn't even want to *have* children."  
  
Joel, according to what I overheard because my one excellent ear was pointed right their way, was raised by a workaholic father and a stay-at-home mom. Jennifer's mother, on the other hand, had always earned more than her father had, and that's the way her family liked it.  
  
"Jennifer and Joel are so *great* together," Black Boots said. "They like all the same *stuff*."  
  
"What kind of stuff?"  
  
"You know, furniture, jewelry, clothes, that kind of stuff. They had no problem at *all* agreeing on the engagement ring."  
  
"Yeah, but I wonder," Pink Sweater said, "if it might become a problem that she wants to continue her career and never be a mother."  
  
"Oh, that's just a little thing. About everything else, they're cool."  
  
"Yeah, you're right." P.S. agreed, relaxing her standards along with her shoulders. "I wish I had a relationship like theirs."  
  
With that, they sighed, finished their drinks, and went their separate ways. Back into the cold, hard world, to resume the search for Mr. Not Quite Right.
