      Oops! I meant the writing, not the "stuff"! I do love my "this" all too much, that's why I loved your "this" (the writing part!).  
        
      I am in a very silly mood tonight....

      Oh how true. My mom just had her 91st birthday. I asked her what she wanted, and she said, "If I can't wear it or eat it, don't buy it for me." Since she lives with me, she has already thinned down her possessions. Her sister sold her home of 45 years recently and moved into an assisted living place. She was giving away stuff like crazy, and I was thinking "Don't give any to me." Except for the player piano. I was delighted when she gave that to me. Only now which of my daughters will get it when I go to my reward? Yep. The trouble with stuff, indeed.

      I remember hearing Dr. Richard Swensen speak on a Focus on the Family tape. He is the author of the amazing book MARGIN. He said this, nearly in tears, "People are more important than things." He repeated it twice more. Each time he said it, his words sunk deeper into my heart. Yes, very true.  
        
      People are more important than things.

I'm really in a clear-the-clutter-out-of-my-life mode. The Coca Cola things are all in boxes right now, and I don't even know if I'll unpack them when I move!"

Then, when I put the Christmas stuff away, I forget I ever had the other stuff out and find it, sometimes, YEARS later! At which time I say, \"Why did I ever have this? I don't even like it!\" Seriously. Enough is enough! Often, enough is actually a bit TOO MUCH..."

      I love the book "Margin." I bought it when it first came out because, well you know, a girl just can't have too many books....Oooops.  
        
      I think I'd better find it and give it another read. People are definitely more important than things, lather, rinse, repeat...

      Your daughter is a hoot, Katy!  
        
      And a living, breathing testament to your family's love for one another.  
        
      Love, Staci

      Oh how I collect stuff. And now I work at my church's Thrift Shop every Wednesday. Am I crazy. I have cases and cases of beanie babies, dreamsicles galore, collectibles from a trip to England, Madame Alexander dolls,  
      Sasha dolls,etc. I told my one son who lives  
      close by that everything was to be divided evenly among the four of them. He said, I Quote, "Oh, I'll have the place cleaned out before any of my siblings get here!" Maybe I should sell it all now.

The shorter the rest of my life gets, the easier it is to see where all this is going.  
  
Just so you know, when I say "this," I mean my stuff. The stuff I've spent a lifetime longing for, saving for, going into debt for, acquiring, dusting, repairing, maintaining, showcasing, and storing. Yeah, that stuff.  
  
I've entered the stage of life when I really don't want any more stuff. I remember distinctly when this happened to my grandmother, who--it must be said--had some primo-quality possessions.  
  
"All I ask is that you don't give me one more thing I have to dust," she announced one Christmas when she wasn't much older than I am now. That was easy for her to say, as it turned out, and almost impossible for us to do. Let's be real: How many books of postage stamps can you give your grandma?  
  
Now I'm starting to get it, and big-time. Every once in a while, I offer some treasure of mine to one of the kids, imagining that if they don't exactly value it as much as I do, they'll love it because they love me. That's the way affluenza spreads to the next generation, right?  
  
Don't kid yourselves, people!  
  
The hightly-collectible Scottish and Irish Santa Clauses I am currently embracing unto my bosom from far and wide to the tune of $40 each will someday be distributed by my children, to whom I gave birth in great pain, as part and parcel of the great Kris Kringle Diaspora. Mark my words, no two will be left huddled together as they are scattered into the uttermost parts of the earth, even as far as the outermost edges of eBay. And probably for $2 each.  
  
I know mothers who start collections of Hallmark ornaments for each child upon birth. Don't they know that by age six, those entreprenurial tykes have purchased huge price catalogs of Hallmark ornaments, just ready to collect their cash when Snoopy and Strawberry Shortcake and Barbie finally transfer from Mom's fake tree into their hot little hands?  
  
So, my plans have changed. The accumulation ends here and the great dispersion begins now, with me still alive and kicking and able to spend the cash I raise from getting rid of my own junk without any help from my very willing progeny.  
  
My purse, my friends, is where all "this" is going!
