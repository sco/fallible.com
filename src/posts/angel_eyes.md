Having two children at home, ages five and one, is a lonely and frightening thing. Thank you for giving back to someone like me!"

      That was beautiful. And yes, I have had those type experiences. Sometimes it takes a stranger. "Be wary of entertaining strangers,  
      for some are angels in disguise."

      Lovely!  
        
      I think everyone should impersonate an angel at least once in their life.

Have you ever had a encounter with a complete stranger and afterwards come to the near-certain realization that you’d just been visited by an angel?

You know the kind of angel I’m talking about: one who masquerades as a ragamuffin during the Christmas season, let’s say, on a mission from God to get some selfish Scrooge to recognize his own rousing good fortune long enough to share the wealth.

Yesterday, when I had only slept four hours after a 24-hour bout of wakefulness, I had to go out in public. But the public I had to go out into was an iffy public, a borderline seedy public, so I figured it didn’t matter that I wore my almost-a-bag-lady barn coat, with two major zits plainly uncovered by concealer of any kind.

It didn’t matter that my sweater was purple and my socks were brown and my shoes were white. It didn’t matter—or at least I didn’t care—that I sported a case of bed-head that was anything but, uh, sporty.

All I had to do was run down to a crummy gas station near the interstate and get my car inspected, like Missouri law says I have to do every couple of years. It would take ten minutes, I’d fork over twelve bucks before heading home for a long winter’s nap, and I sure wouldn’t see anybody I knew.

I was right. I didn’t see a body I knew. But it wasn’t a ten minute stop, like I’d hoped. My car needed three hours worth of work to pass inspection, so I decided to wait it out.

If an angel had volunteered to take my place on the greasy folding chair in the two-seater waiting area, and just called me when the whole unsavory ordeal was over, I would have kissed her feet. But what kind of an angel would volunteer a stint in a joint like this? One of those fake-homeless angels like Roma Downey, strung out on too many over-caffeinated cappucinos? 

Toward the end of my wait, a young girl came in to get her car inspected. She cast a too-trusting look in my direction, must have decided my questionable company was better than none, and sat down next to me. We talked about the weather, but only for a few seconds before we moved on, to her upbringing in Iowa and her move to Kansas City just a few months ago. 

We talked about college, and how her new husband had quit after two years and joined the military. 

“He left for Iraq the week before Thanksgiving,” she said. “I can’t even turn on the news, I’m so upset. I just have to go to work, and try not to think about it.”

Then she told me about her job teaching second graders at a small Christian school in an even seedier part of town. I noticed the green magic marker streak on her sweater and the specks of silver glitter on her shoe.

The subject came back around to her soldier-husband.

“Has he called home since he’s been there?” I asked.

“No. He called from Kuwait to say he was on his way to Iraq, but I haven’t heard anything since he’s been there. I don’t even know where in Iraq he is. Besides, it’s so expensive to call…”

Do you ever look for angels in day-to-day life? I don’t very often, I have to admit, but the Bible gives every indication I may have been in the presence of them—and even seen them without realizing their identity—on any number of occasions.

Somehow, though, this girl—with the clear-nail-polish-stopped runs in her black stockings and her fresh-scrubbed face—looked just like an angel to me.

They called her name after only ten minutes, and I watched as she carefully drew twelve dollars from her purse and laid them individually on the counter, as if the drawn-out process would somehow make them last longer. She thanked the attendant and turned to leave.

She beamed a radiant smile in my direction.

“Merry Christmas,” she said, reaching for my hand.

Are pretty young angels really surprised when mere mortals press a wad of cash into their open palms?

“Buy your husband a calling card,” I said. “Tell him it’s from a weird chick you met at the gas station. That’ll keep him guessing.”

She took the money and embraced me,  promising to send him the card. I’m sure he’ll call home soon. Who wouldn’t call if he knew an angel waited on the other end?

She left the station and as she walked toward her car, she turned around and flashed me another big grin. But this time, there was something like a flicker of recognition in her eyes.

Yesterday, I looked—and felt—like a human being in desperate need of her own personal angel.

Today, there’s a lonely girl in Kansas City who thinks a bag lady named Katy just might have been one.
