Doug and I are in the "Just Give Us All Of It" tax bracket. And since we started (n)genius media, inc. five years ago, the forms we must submit on an almost daily basis are overwhelming.  
  
Last January, our corporation mistakenly payed a huge chunk of change to the feds, on the advice of our accountant, who did not realize we'd been making monthly payments all along. We're still trying to get our refund.  
  
In the meantime, though, we screwed up our quarterly employer's report (put a piece of info on the wrong line, or something) and now they claim we owe them a tremendous penalty for filing incorrectly.  
  
And we owe them *immediately*, if we wish to avoid further interest and penalties.  
  
Some days, I want to walk with Jesus for the right reasons. I want to get to know Him better, to draw close to him, serve Him, and love Him.  
  
Other days, I'd just like to be sidled up next to Him when He catches the fish with the coins in its mouth, and He pays off the disciples' back taxes with the proceeds.  
  
Some days are better than others.
