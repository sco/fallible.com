It's hard to know how to pray when someone young and lovely and vibrant leaves this world much sooner than we think she should. Somehow, I found myself barely capable of "groanings too deep for words." "God, bring some good out of this," I prayed. "May the Catholics and the Protestants in Sheryl's community come together over her death, and that of her sister." I prayed, but after years upon years of evidence to the contrary, I didn't quite believe. We just spoke by phone to her parents, Michael and Gwen, in Sixmilecross, County Tyrone, Northern Ireland. Each of us shared our feelings of loss and of joy in knowing such a wonderful girl. "At the funeral, the minister from the Church of Ireland sat up by the altar with the Catholic priest," said Michael, a Catholic. The priest expressed the unity of the pastors and their flocks over the town's loss of the sisters. "And now the minister has called and asked me to speak at his church about my daughters. I think I'm going to do it." "You should," we said. "It will bring healing, and Sheryl would want it." "And not only that," he said. "The Orange Order parade scheduled for July 12 in Sixmilecross was cancelled in honor of our daughters. To my knowledge, that has never happened before." Yes, it's hard to know how to pray. But even I can groan, and almost believe. And even when we're faithless, He remains faithful.
