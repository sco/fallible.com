I try with words to heal myself,  
To claim a cure for ills unknown,  
But only find my voice is hoarse,  
More seed among the symptoms sown.

I try with words to find myself,  
Search through the stories and the tales,  
Pick over what has come to ruin,  
Old successes and new fails.

I try with words to save myself,  
Who cannot save the flower’s bloom,  
But end up using still more words,  
‘Til filling my heart’s every room.
