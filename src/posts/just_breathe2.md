      Ah... but that's the miracle of mindfulness. It is amazing how eternal one moment can be, huh?

I'm sitting in a velvet chair at Starbucks, reading *The Call* by Os Guinness, one apt phrase at a time, slowly.  
  
For the first time in several days, I begin to relax, just a little at first, then almost completely. My shoulders drop from their recent highs to what might be near their all-time lows. I hear myself say, "Oh..." a couple of times in response to something I read, and then all falls silent.  
  
I stop registering the background music, cease picking up on the animated chatter of the other patrons.  
  
One short phrase, a rest, then another phrase, and another rest. Soon, more resting than phrases. Time passes, and perhaps a bit of eternity with it.  
  
Then I jolt at the sight of my own chest rising and falling with mortal, rhythmic, even breaths, as if I hadn't, for a flickering second, been somewhere else, where oxygen is overrated.  
  
Every once in a great while, a temporal moment becomes so much like an eternal one, mere breath seems unnecessary, even impossible.  
  
Still, I gasp and fill my lungs with it, certain it must be the breath of heaven.
