      Ooooh...these are good. I'm afraid what comes to my mind is not pretty: responsible and resentful.  
        
      I need to give one of them up, I'm thinking.

      OK, now I'm fascinated with all the attributes that "procrastination" can be negatively mixed with. They all feel VERY familiar to me!  
        
      Hmmm....fascination and procrastination.

Kevin just figured out something about himself, and he brought it to my attention, instead of the other way around.  
  
"Being lazy and patient is a really bad combination. And I'm both."  
  
Whoa, baby! Can't say he's not honest, though, can I?  
  
Any crummy combinations you're living with?
