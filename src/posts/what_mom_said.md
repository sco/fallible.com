      Mom, I die every time I hear that story. Because of you, my underwear is always clean...of course if anything should happen, the paramedics might be a little surprised by my $.99 Rue 21 message underwear. Let me tell you, this is no day of the week underwear...I'll leave it at that.

      It is unfortunate when healthcare workers shred off patient clothes. If the patient is conscious, most ER docs have the compassion to kindly tell the patient that, sorry, but the Victoria's Secret thong must come off because of any unseen injury. Taking off clothes requires moving, and sometimes you don't want patients to move (broken neck, broken pelvis, etc.).  
        
      My conventional wisdom: Bloggers who write well should write more often for their audience. ;)

      Maria, You are just the doctor-in-training I was thinking of when I wrote this! I was barely conscious at the time of the underwear fiasco, and Fiona must have made an exec decision that the $2 bra wasn't much to sacrifice....  
      Thanks for the encouragement to be about my blogging. I intend to do just that. ;)

I've been thinking about the conventional wisdom mothers pass down to their children, and how it can come back to bite you. Who would think that "Always remember to wear clean underwear, in case you're in an accident" could backfire?  
  
I think so, that's who.  
  
When Scott and Carrie were babies, I was the unwitting victim of a string of gastrointestinal disasters. My typical pattern was for horrible stomach cramps to set in, followed immediately by weakness, sweating, puking, diarrhea and--if God was particularly merciful--passing out.  
  
The worst of these incidents occurred while I was at work one night, checking groceries. The cramps started but I valiantly tried not to abandon my check-out lane, which was filled with customers. When my co-worker let me know that no, the lights *weren't* dimming, I ran to the john.  
  
That's about all I remember, until I awakened and Doug was there with me in the bathroom. The next time I came to, I was laid out on the cold concrete floor of the store's back room, and three paramedics--two men and a girl named Fiona, for whom I named a character in my novel without even realizing it until just now--worked feverishly to detect any blood pressure at all. (It would be three long hours before anyone could find a pressure. Seriously.)  
  
While I slipped in and out of consciousness and the teenage boy sackers watched, the paramedics cut off my blouse, which had perfectly operable buttons, and sliced through the center of my brand new $2 bra, just for good measure. (Hey, do you think these events explain why so much of my blogging ends up being about underwear?)  
  
Time passed. My temperature dropped. My lips and fingernails turned blue. My blood pressure stabilized at zero over zero.  
  
The intensive care unit became my cocoon that night, and it was there my sisters visited me the next day, bearing gifts, of course. I opened the lingerie store box, not feeling quite up to lingerie, if I remember right.  
  
"I thought you might need a new bra," Liz laughed. Funny girl, that Liz. I'd told her the humiliating story of being laid bare on the stone-cold storeroom floor, and she'd run with it.  
  
Then I pulled out the matching panties. "Well," I said, struggling to recall the events of the previous night, "I love the set, but the paramedics only destroyed my bra."  
  
"But I thought you said," Liz clarified, "that before the ambulance arrived, when you and Doug were in the bathroom and you couldn't stop passing out, you made him get you out of your ruined underwear and back into your jeans..."  
  
My sisters and I put bra and unders together, and it wasn't pretty. When the paramedics unzipped my jeans to examine my abdomen, I was clearly sans panties, but at that very foggy time, I didn't remember removing them. I still wonder what they must have thought when I, a mother of two children, looked up at them and said, "It's a good thing I wore clean underwear."  
  
At least, the highly trained medical professionals had the common decency not to laugh.  
  
Have you had a piece of common parental wisdom turn on you? I've shown you mine (ouch!), now you show me yours.  
  
BTW, I am hereby, with this blog entry, committed to leaving the subject of underwear behind.
