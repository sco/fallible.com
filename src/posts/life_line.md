      One of my favorite lines is from my favorite movie, Harvey. Elwood (Jimmy Stewart) is talking to the psychologist and he says, "My mother always told me that in this life you must be oh so smart or oh so kind. For thirty years I tried smart. I recommend kind."

I feel, I feel...I feel like spring after winter, and sun on the leaves; and like trumpets and harps and all the songs I have ever heard!\" This kind of pure joy after great difficulty is an unforgettable memory."

      My daughter sent me an e-mail with several possible answers to 'why did the chicken cross the road?'. Most of them were quotes from movies. For weeks I wasted valuable time thinking of things to add to the list, like 'One word. Plastics.' or 'Forget about the chicken, Jake. It's Chinatown' or 'Frankly, my dear...." Well, you get the idea. When you see somebody in the next car at a light with a silly grin on his face, that's what he's doing.  
      There are many quotes from movies that have stuck indelibly in my mind. I don't know that any of them were life changing, though.  
      My favorite quote is from James Thurber:  
      You might as well fall on your face as to lean over too far backwards.

Read an article about him recently where he talks about growing up with his mentally unstable mom, and the great gifts he received from her. Seems like a very cool young man."

      Sean Astin is Patty Duke's son? The cute little kid (of course, he's not little anymore and almost 10 years older than I am) from The Goonies and the one who stole our hearts as Rudy? I had no idea!  
        
      Okay, so after reading your comment I just went to the IMDB and looked him up. His dad is John Astin, famous for playing Gomez on The Addams Family. Crazy.  
        
      And Samwise Gamgee was my absolute favorite. What a sweet and faithful friend. Sigh.

The Dustin Hoffman character says, \"We were good FRIENDS...\" when he refers to how he first fell in love with the Jessica Lange character. I saw that with my favorite high school boyfriend, and it always stuck with me. :)"

      I think I skimmed that article you read, Katy. I vaguely remember thinking how inexplicable grace is; one person is overcome by the circumstances they're born into and another is able to grow despite all. Sometimes there's just no other explanation for it.  
        
      I love quotes - here's my very favorite, but it's not in a book, movie or song. It's from a letter that Louise Bogan wrote to William Carlos Williams commenting on one of his poems.  
      "I cannot believe the inscrutable universe turns on an axis of suffering. Surely, the strange beauty of the world must somewhere rest on pure joy." And I can only say "Amen!"

    text: "One phrase which has had a profound affect on my understanding of the way God loves me is pretty simple. It came from a song from a team from the International House of Prayer in Kansas City. \"Even in my weakness, you have found me lovely.\" God in his great mercy and love, loves me even in the middle of my weaknesses. It blows me away every time I hear it."

      I have whole journals devoted to my collection of quotes. This one is not from a movie, but is one of my guiding lights: "Don't let what you are being get in the way of what you might become." Harry Palmer  
        
      But a classic movie line? That I never forgot? And have seen repeated for however many years in a row now? Dorothy to the Scarecrow: "What would you do with a brain if you had one?" Now THERE'S a loaded question. :-)

He says to him: \"Reuven,listen to me. The Talmud says a person should do two things for himself. One is acquire a teacher. The other is acquire a friend.\" When the son blithely responds that he likes him, his father continues, \"No. Listen to me. I am not talking about liking him. I am telling you to make him your friend and to let him make you his friend.\" That is rich."

      Hi there, I am from india and my favorite line is from the song of a movie title KAL HO NA HO (May not be tommorrow. It's in hindi and am translating it in rnglish. It is sonmething like this.  
        
      Life is changing it's beauty every time,  
      Sometimes it's shadow, sometimes it's sunshine,  
      Live every moment here to your heart's content,  
      The time that is here may not be tomorrow  
        
      Every time i hear this song, it just blows me away. I feel so motivated and inspired every time i listen to this song. It makes me comprehend the fact that i should live life by moment rahter than dwelling in past mistakes or thinkin' about future. Awe-inspiring song that strike a chord deep within you.

If you had to name *one line* from a book, movie, or song, a single line which has changed your life--perhaps *forever*!--what would it be?  
  
There's a line in Leon Uris's novel *Trinity* which I return to daily. It's become a stalwart standard of absolute truth in my rapidly changing world.  
  
In the scene, an old, poverty-stricken Irish mother has just set the table with a humble meal of home-grown very red meat, vegetables, and black bread. She turns to her adult sons and their mistrusting friend from the city--who fancies himself used to finer fare--and says with pride, "Don't be afraid of the butter."  
  
How could that line not change my life? In those few words, I came to know that it's the trans-fats that are to be feared, not the God-given butter.  
  
How about you? Give me one good line.
