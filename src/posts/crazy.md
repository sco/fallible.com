Just poppin’ in to say things are crazy here. I’m getting ready (yes, again!) to go to the American Christian Fiction Writers (ACFW) conference four weeks from today. And guess what? This year, Doug’s going with me!

I’m really excited about that. Doug helps me so much with brainstorming, editing, and general encouragement to keep plugging away at this writing thing that it’s a shame for him to miss out on all the fun.

And, no, my first novel hasn’t been picked up by a publisher yet. The only cure for that is to write the next novel, which is now well underway. My wonderful agent Rachelle Gardner continues to inspire me and urge me onward and upward.

I’ll probably be sneaking over here when I get a chance, but for the next few weeks I’ve got to focus on getting some strong material ready to take with me to Denver. We’ll be privileged to sit in on the teaching of Donald Maass, a great agent who wrote Writing the Breakout Novel and The Career Novelist. I’ve only ever heard five-star reviews of his workshops, so we’re really looking forward to that.

Will check in again as time and novel-writing permit. I love each and every one of you loyal fallible ones, and don’t you forget it!
