      I can explain the balls...teachers often put them on the bottom of students' chairs, too. It keeps the bottoms of chairs from making noise, from slipping and sliding on the floor (God help those ADHD kids!) and from scratching up the floor with black marks. Maybe that's why the old folks use them, too. What do ya think?

    text: "But why do the walker-makers make walkers without these features built-in, if they're so important to consumers--which they obviously are? That's what blows my mind--thirty plus years of tennis balls!! And the crazy looking product pictured here raises another issue: How many people have sliced their hands when they're trying to slice their tennis balls to retrofit them for walkers/chairs, etc.? I'd like to know the statistics on that little ER run... Thanks, Bridgie!! (Hey, congrats on your job for next year, teaching writing to 8th graders! I'm so proud of you!)"

      I thought I remembered reading that your mom refused to use the walker!  
        
      I think the tennis balls are green for 'go'... as in, "There's no red light on this thing, sonny, so watch out world, here I come!!" teeheehee

      Take Care Michael--I cheerfully extend upwards of 70x7 sporting chances!! But then,  
      I've just finished an excellent cup of coffee... :)  
        
      Irene--Mom did refuse to use her walker a lot for months! It was a trying time for those of us trying to take her anywhere. Now she's under strict doctor's orders, and for the most part, I think she's obeying. Unfortunately, now we know a lot more about her condition. Her bones could sustain "pathological fractures" at any time, meaning she wouldn't have to fall or be injured for it to happen. She could sneeze. Kind of scary...

When she puts the frisbee away she says \"stay with me\" and I usually listen. Usually. This time, things got a little more dramatic. This time, as we got closer to the creek, I just couldn't help myself and I jumped down into the creek."

    text: "Injury can be very detrimental to seniors I know, I had to help my mother for a whole month after she sprained her ankle."

You could say that the crowd I'm hanging with these days isn't too swift.  
  
So maybe that's why I'm so keyed in to the amazing variety of assistive devices available on the market. I remember back when my grandma broke her leg helping my mother throw a garage sale in the sixties, when the only type of walker we knew about had to be lifted completely off the ground between each couple of steps.  
  
Maybe the oldsters haven't picked up a lot of speed since then, but they've sure picked up a little. Last summer, when my mom blew out her knee and ended up needing surgery, I hightailed it over to Wal-mart and got her what she's since come to proudly refer to as the "Cadillac of walkers."  
  
Don't imagine there's not a pecking order in retirement homes--there is. If you've got to succumb to using a walker, you wouldn't be caught dead with one like my poor grandma had to hobble around with. They still make those, but when was the last time you saw a self-respecting senior shuffling along behind one?  
  
If you injure yourself and are privileged enough to be able to acquire the four-wheeled, hand-braked type with the seat that lifts up to reveal a roomy storage compartment, like my mom's, you've scored more than an excellent walker. You've also exponentially elevated your own status, and probably set yourself up to be invited to join the in crowd.  
  
Oh, yeah. No matter how old you get, there's always an in crowd.  
  
So, here's my question. What the heck is up with the lime green, flourescent tennis balls that hapless handicapped folks have been attaching to the front legs of their old-fashioned walkers for the past, oh, thirty years or so? I'm guessing these seniors don't like walkers with four wheels because they're afraid those puppies are going to get away from them, but isn't there another solution? And why aren't orange or yellow tennis balls ever used? Is lime green code for something I just don't get?  
  
Maybe the entire nation's elders, flourescent walkers in single file like the robots in a Will Smith movie, are in training to blow those retirement-home pop stands en masse on some dark, moonless night. Don't put it past them.  
  
I googled "walker tennis balls" to see if I could gain any insight, and instead I gained the assistive-device industry's response to the senior population's obvious affinity for lime green tennis balls. Do you think it'll catch on?  
  
All I know is, unless Mom ponies up, she may not be part of the in crowd for long.
