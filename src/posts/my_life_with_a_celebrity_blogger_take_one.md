      Are you sure you didn't mean "Mediocre Rise"?

It has been humbly suggested over at [Doug's site](http://www.marginalcomments.com) that he is riding the coat tails of my blogging success to his own meteoric rise in the blogosphere. As of this very hour, that preposterous idea is SO three days ago!  
  
Congrats to radio personality and super-fun blogger [Cindy Swanson](http://cindyswanslife.blogspot.com/) for adding Doug to her list of illustrious interviewees. And kudos to Doug for his brilliant and swift-thinking answer to Question Number Five. I predict the guy will go far.  
  
Thanks, Cindy!
