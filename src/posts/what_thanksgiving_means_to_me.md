      Katy, is the book editor new news? Congratulations in any case, whether new or old! (Oh, by the way, I don't have to do the being thankful assignment because I'm Canadian, and I've already been thankful) ;)

But I've decided to be thankful that they're will be an interested editor. Maybe my thanksgiving will keep me moving forward. So, you Canadians get to be thankful early and get it over with, huh? :) What does your celebration typically consist of?"

      Would that I'd have an auspicious twin like you!  
        
      I'm sure our Thanksgiving celebration is similar to yours - great food and lots of it, like turkey, cranberries, veggies, yams, potatoes, gravy, rolls, pumpkin pie, and lots of family get-togethers. But yours is always on last Thursday of Nov. right? Ours always falls on 2nd Monday of October.

I thought my 22-year-old daughter and I were just making a routine run for her pre-op admission procedures at Research Hospital, but I was wrong.  
  
First of all, nothing is routine when your child is having surgery, even if she is an adult. And secondly, Carrie's still my little girl.  
  
She told the nurse she's very excited, and that probably explained why her blood pressure was elevated to almost normal levels (oh, my!) Carrie's right foot is going to be operated on tomorrow morning by Dr. Robert Bruce. (All prayers appreciated!) It has a big bump on top, a bone spur which is most likely the result of her broken foot not healing right when she was ten.  
  
Back when she was a grown up, or at least so she seemed to me.  
  
"Will I get to wear a hospital bracelet?" she asked me this morning. "I love those!"  
  
"Yes, baby, you'll get a bracelet with your name on it..."  
  
And then the nurse called us in for the rigamarole, the thousands of questions about neurological disorders and cancer and stroke and cataracts. It's such a miracle to be young and healthy (or old and healthy!) and to be able to answer "No, no, no, no..." to all these questions. It's such a wonder to be innocent enough to not even know what some of the conditions are--like, say, renal failure--but to be smart enough to know that if you don't know, you must not be a victim.  
  
When the nurse got to the more personal questions, I almost asked Carrie if she wanted me to leave the room, but she fired away her happy "No's" like streams of water over a falls.  
  
"Any STDs?"  
  
"No."  
  
"Any recreational drug use?"  
  
"No."  
  
"Could you be pregnant right now?"  
  
"No."  
  
Carrie shot me a couple smiles during the interrogation, but I don't think she saw the tears welling up in my eyes. I don't think she knows how honored I felt to be sitting in her presence, how much I admire the childlike faith in Jesus that has led her to hold such strong convictions, how much I wish I could be even remotely like the woman she's become almost overnight.  
  
I have a ways to grow to be like Carrie, and I know it. But while I'm watching and learning, my heart is overflowing with gratitude for the gift of a beautiful daughter.  
  
And this is my Thanksgiving story.
