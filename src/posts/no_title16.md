A splash of booze, a small quantity of chocolate syrup (once in a while) or other flavoring stirred into the foam (heated in a large mug in the microwave until the foam reaches the top of the mug) with a shot or two of coffee poured through the foam, and even a low (not absent) carb dude like me is happy."

Until now, the only places that know me by name are my bank (where I make deposits) and various and sundry doctors and hospitals (where they make withdrawals). I'm going back to that policy, except I'd like to stop being on a first name basis with the docs. xox"

      i always say it's good to take a break when people at any restaurant/store know your name/face just because you spend money there so often. at least that's my policy.

If I confessed how much money my husband and I have spent in Starbuck's in the past 18 months (since my addiction kicked in), you'd be embarrassed for me. Let's just say for the same amount, I could have had a lot of things that wouldn't have been nearly as much fun. Still, our fortunes have reversed and we must be realistic: Starbuck's or Retirement? Starbuck's or College for the Kids? You know the drill. In the process of getting our financial house in order, we are getting rid of stuff that somebody else could be using, good stuff for which we can claim a tax deduction at the end of the year. Some of it is new stuff, acquired through a website where you paid for the merchandise, received it, filled out rebate forms for all of it, and got ALL your money back. Today I found a manual milk frother, which looks like a coffee press, and perfectly froths enough milk for two in about 30 seconds. I didn't even know I had it--it had been in my "gift closet" for three years. I didn't pay a cent for it, and it meets my frivilous need for froth fantastically. Starbuck's will forget our names soon, and our faces by and by. It is best this way. And it goes to show that froth--like information--really does want to be free.
