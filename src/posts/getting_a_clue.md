      Hi, Katy!  
      Is this a hypothetical? I hope not, I hope you are actually "in talks" with a publisher or agent or whatever! Anyway, about me: I'm 32 years old, been married 10 years. I'm a stay-at-home homeschooling Mom to my four munchkins: Natalie, age 8; Noah, age 6; Jonathan, age 5; and Josiah, age 3. We are members of a Free Methodist church, but this has more to do with loving the people and it being the best fit in our area than a certain denominational affiliation. I lead worship once a month for Sunday services, and every week for our ladies' Bible study. And your blog is one of the first things I do every day!

I was raised Lutheran but go to a Science of Mind church when I go, which isn't that often. I'm also so liberal that I sometimes agree with the conservatives, but only sometimes! I'm betting your readers will be from a very wide range of backgrounds."

      I'm 50 and widowed. I have two children still at home--one teenager and one who's grown but likes home cooked food too much to leave.  
        
      And I'm a protestent nondenominational who goes to a Baptist church.  
        
      Ooh, and I'm Canadian--that might help increase your diversity quotient a little.

I have gone to various churches in the PCA (Presbyterian Church of America) all my life, and I am quite involved with their campus ministry, Reformed University Fellowship (RUF). I am unmarried and childless for now, which is good, because I can barely handle doing my own laundry. I don't remember exactly when I started reading fallible, but I do know that it was via your son Scott. And hey, remember when we had lunch in KC that one time? :) That was fun."

      Let's see...  
        
      I'm 32, married, and have zero children (as of now). I'm a graphic designer. I go to Jacob's Well. I grew up in Southern CA, with a 7-year stint in Denver, CO as a kid. I miss CA, but I like it better here. I went to art school after a 7-year career designing computer games. I like making experimental films. I have recorded three CDs... And, seemingly, I have a thing for 7-years durations.

      The best way to get people to comment on your blog is to ask them to talk about themselves. We're such a me-centered society, aren't we? =)

      I'm Canadian, almost 50 years old, married 31 years, with 2 married daughters who have 5 beautiful children between them.  
        
      I am not able to work due to debilitating fibromyalgia symptoms. I was a homemaker while my children were growing up. When my children were almost adults I went to school for a year to get a certificate in bookkeeping with computer applications and worked in a number of temporary jobs before my symptoms became too severe to continue. Now I'm a homemaker again.  
        
      I currently attend an Evangelical Free Church but have been a member of a number of protestant denominations over the years.  
        
      I've only been reading your blog for a short time but I'm very impressed!

      Hi Katy, I'm sort of a new reader here but have really enjoyed hearing your thoughts and stories.  
        
      I'm 22, engaged to be married in August, and finishing an English degree at Azusa Pacific University in Southern California. Sadly, I'm entering the big world of life after school in just a few weeks here...  
        
      I love to write and have done a little bit of freelancing, but I hope to work for a magazine or possibly a newspaper.  
        
      Oh, and I go to a Vineyard church, but I'm not really tied to any denomination.

      Hi Katy,  
        
      \* I've been reading you for at least a year or so; I found you through Sara Cat, formerly of foolishness.net.  
      \* I'm 23, married, no kids.  
      \* I graduated from college almost a year ago with a B.A. in English/writing. I'm currently working at a Christian bookstore, which has nothing to do with my degree, but I'd like to go into editing/proofreading, and since I live in a Christian publishing mecca (Grand Rapids, Mich.), hopefully that will happen soon.  
      \* I fantasize about writing, but have no self-confidence and very little stamina. I'd get more writing practice if I maintained a regular blog, but instead I live vicariously through others' blogs (like yours!). However, my husband is currently attempting to persuade me to jump on the bandwagon of his fantasy novel and breath a little life into his skin-and-bones writing style.  
      \* I grew up in the Church of the Nazarene, but my current home is a Vineyard fellowship, and I see I'm not the only one...

So if an editor or agent or publisher asked me to describe my blog readership, what should I say?  
  
If a whole bunch of you would leave a comment with your age, marital status, ages of kids, etc., I'd have a more accurate idea than I do right now. Throw in something about your occupation and church affiliation, too, if you'd like. Anything you want to share about yourself. I like to think I know my readers, but you may surprise me!  
  
Go ahead. I love surprises.
