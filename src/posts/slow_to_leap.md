      Good concept, but I'm lost in the political-christian-speak. What exactly is 'faith-based initiative'? Are you talking about stuff like actually going to the (where I live) downtown east side to hand out blankets and hold the hand of a druggie while she's coming down? Or starting a 'ministry'? Or what? Sounds good - but vague.

      The president has talked a lot about the government lending financial aid to "faith-based initiatives" (like ministries to the homeless, etc.) as opposed to our taxes strictly financing government-operated programs for the needy. He is of the opinion that people of faith do at least as good a job of reaching the needy as the government does.  
        
      I agree, but it's become too easy for me as an individual to throw some money at charity, rather than getting involved hands-on. I apologize for being vague, Violet, but these are still vague awakenings I'm dealing with. Inklings, stirrings...In my case, I've been making baby afghans for a birthing center in the urban core, so that each new mom (high school girls, mostly) will go home with a handmade blanket for her baby. But I'm thinking of taking the next step, which for me would mean volunteering at the clinic to do whatever is needed there.  
        
      For me, that would represent my own personal "faith-based initiative."

      Joining a state guard is a good way to help, too if you're interested. No prior military experience is needed, and they'll take anyone willing to help.  
        
      Alternatives include helping the Salvation Army, soup kitchen volunteering like the House Of Bread, and since the Christmas season is fast aproaching, The Special Wish Foundation.  
        
      I volunteered for Special Wish one year, and it was amazing.  
        
      Hope that helps.

(Sorry if my tone was strident in my question above - it bothered me all through my women's morning out - ouch!). May God's blessing, and coordination be with you."

      Good for you.  
        
      Remember that works is not about the show, it is about the heart. Don't let the grandness or fancy words like "faith based initiatives" be your guide.  
      Don't do the works because you feel you need to, do the works because your heart demands it.  
      I am not suggesting that serving at the clinic isn't a good idea. I am sure it is. Don't get trapped into thinking that works is a dues you pay and that 2 hours a week is what it takes.  
        
      Works is about caring. Works is about allowing your heart to lead you. Its kindness and respect you pay to everyone that you meet...  
        
      And still there is always a first step, a next step and so on.  
        
      ... Forgive my ramble. My intent was to show my applause and to remind you that works come in small packages too.  
        
      Take Care

Election season is over, and I really don't mean to wax Republican here, but there's a phrase I haven't been able to get off my mind these past few days.  
  
Maybe it happened because of meeting Will and Lisa Samson, and seeing firsthand how God is leading them to not just talk, but to do. To not just write about it, but to live it. To not just give lip service to social justice, but to do something real to ease the burden of another human being.  
  
"Faith-based initiative." That's what I'm talking about. Only not just as an alternative to government programs to assist the less fortunate, but rather as a personal calling.  
  
The Scripture says that without faith, no one can please God, but what about after faith? Is faith all there is?  
  
"Faith without works is dead."  
  
My faith should be all the initiative I need to do the "good works that God has prepared beforehand, that I should walk in them," but there's a weird sense in which I've let it become more of an insulator than an activator.  
  
So. This may seem a little abrupt coming from a chick who's only been a follower of Jesus for a mere 35 years, but I think I'm about to leap onto a couple of faith-based initiative bandwagons.  
  
I'm not overly coordinated. Wish me luck.
