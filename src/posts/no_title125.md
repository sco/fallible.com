I'm seriously looking at some Master's degree programs right now, but each one seems to have a drawback. Most of the ones I see advertised in the Kansas City Star are targeting students who wish to pursue an MBA. I'm not much of a businessperson, so that's out. To fill the void, I may just take up balancing my checkbook. Some of the Master's programs require at least partial residency, and I have to admit that sounds like fun. What could be better than receiving a Master of Fine Arts in Creative Nonfiction from a hoity-toity university in New England, especially if they force you to stay there and enjoy food that someone else cooks and stay in a room so small it couldn't possibly take more than three minutes to clean? I've been through worse. Still, my marriage contract includes a prior "residency requirement" which I signed up for twenty-five years ago and won't be reneging on in this lifetime. The one thing all these Master's programs have in common is that you have to get a Bachelor's degree first. It's always something.
