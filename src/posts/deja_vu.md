"Are you in the shower?"  
  
Her voice was thin, shaky, and I could picture her holding the phone away from her face, on the edge of hanging up and moving on down her list of memorized numbers.  
  
When the phone rings as early as it did Tuesday morning, I know what's coming. Other people's mothers, though, might start a conversation with "Are you awake?" or "Are you eating?" or "Are you in the middle of something?"  
  
Not my mom.  
  
"No," I said, calmly, but on red alert. "I'm not in the shower. I'm sitting at my desk, talking to you. What's going on?"  
  
I knew as soon as I heard her voice precisely what was going on, and that the day had finally come to admit her to a psychiatric unit. By the end of the day, the deed was done.  
  
She had many crying jags that day, making it like most days recently. At one point, she looked at me and said, "This is the day my mom died, thirty years ago."  
  
I'd forgotten the date somehow, and the knowledge of it startled me, especially since Mom had let me know that she herself wouldn't be surviving to see the next day.  
  
And then it hit me. The day Grandma died, when I was eighteen, I didn't immediately answer my phone when the call came. Mom tried to reach me five or six times in a twenty minute period on that long ago death day. I would have responded, of course, but I was in the shower.  
  
"Are you in the shower?" Mom asked.  
  
No, Mom. I'm right here.
