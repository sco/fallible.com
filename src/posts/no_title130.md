And another thing-- Time was when a reader could pick up a newspaper and get the who, what, where, when and why all presented in the first short paragraph, something like this: Mrs. Katy Raymond, 48, of Belton, MO, has fallen into a serious disagreement with her 22-year-old son, Scott Raymond, of Lawrence, KS. It all began around noon on Saturday, when the younger Raymond responded to his mother's recent blog with a comment of his own. Now they have entered an embittered battle, the consequences of which could affect both the quality and quantity of the Christmas presents exchanged two weeks from now. \[Until recent years, the rest of the story would have referred to the mother as Mrs. Raymond, and to the son as either Scott or Mr. Raymond, or even Raymond. Then, not too very long ago, Mrs. Raymond became a Ms. whether she objected or not. Now things have gotten even worse, and the final paragraph might currently appear something like this:\] Within just a few days, Raymond will receive a Linguistics degree from the University of Kansas, and yet Raymond persists in arguing over and over again about English usage questions that Raymond finds elementary. "I haven't lived this long for nothing," says Raymond, "and I intend to gain the upper hand." "We'll see," says Raymond, "but I'm gonna' have the final word."
