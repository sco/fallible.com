There is much I could, and will, share about the past ten days. But for now, only this: Doug and I stopped at Walmart a few minutes ago to pick up one item, which I hoped would remain unmentionable. What was I thinking? When you live with a teenager, nothing is sacred. "So, wha'd ya get?" Kev asked, as soon as he saw the bag. "Glycerin suppositories," I said, still hoping. "What's that?" OK, then. "You stick it as far as you can up your rear end, and it makes you have a bowel movement." "Sweet." Easy for him to say.
