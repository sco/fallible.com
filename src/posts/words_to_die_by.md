      It's interesting you wrote about this today..I came across this story this morning and was tossing it around as possible "blog fodder"

      Florida preacher dies during sermon  
        
      THE ASSOCIATED PRESS  
        
      OVIEDO, Fla. -- A Presbyterian minister collapsed and died at the pulpit after saying "And when I go to heaven...," his colleague said.  
        
      The Rev. Jack Arnold, 69, was nearing the end of his sermon Sunday at Covenant Presbyterian Church when he grabbed the podium before falling to the floor, said the Rev. Michael S. Beats, the church's associate pastor.  
        
      Before collapsing, Arnold quoted the 18th-century Bible scholar John Wesley who said, "Until my work on this earth is done, I am immortal. But when my work for Christ is done ... I go to be with Jesus."

      The story goes on...but it is a little eerie. Not sure how anyone could top that sermon's message...tough act to follow.

      Hi, Michael! (I don't know why I'm so impressed that there are three Michaels posting comments here, but I am...)  
      I linked to the article you refer to in my post. What could be better than having your last words refer directly to what will happen immediately after you utter them?

      my father's last words to my mother, as he dropped her off at work 4 hours before he had a heart attack in his car: "you're blessed." and he kissed her.  
        
      to me, his last words came the day before, over the phone. we talked of how far my cordless phone could wander away from its base before becoming staticky. and he told me that those damned phone salesman weren't bothering him anymore since he got caller ID. "i just don't even pick up the phone. ha!"

      My mother in law said, "Look there's Big Ben  
      as she looked out her hospital window. She thought she was in London." Six months  
      later we were in England. She also said,  
      "Is the baby born yet?" She also talked to her  
      brother Donald who had passed away six months earlier. Strange. Maybe in passing they are in a "no time zone".

I've always been fascinated by the last words people speak before they die.  
  
The girl who used to babysit my sisters and me when we were kids died at age forty. She and her hubby were eating at TGI Friday's, having a wonderful evening together. In the middle of laughing and carrying on, she stood to her feet and said, "Oh, my head!" before keeling over dead.  
  
There are disputed stories regarding my father's last words. The last words he said to me, before he fell fatally ill, were "My God, you're butt's getting big." My sister Liz was with him within a few hours of his death, when his condition had supposedly rendered him speechless, and she swears he said, "I coming to see you, Patrick." Patrick is my older brother, who died when I was two.  
  
I like Liz's story better! And just for the record, my butt wasn't that big.  
  
Here are [a few last words](http://apnews.myway.com/article/20050111/D87HKMPO0.html) that put a life in context quickly, and leave the listeners with an memorable visual aid, don't you think? What a way to go!  
  
Any famous last words among folks you've known?
