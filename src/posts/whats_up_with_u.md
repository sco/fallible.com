      Wow, talk about timing! I come to check your blog, seeing no new post, I start to read past postings, then I come back to the main page and BAM there's a new post just waiting for me to read!  
        
      Here's my votes: fraught, suburb, and miniscule. I'm pretty sure on suburb, and the other two I have no idea. One word I always have problems spelling is "spent." For some reason, I always like to spell it "speant." I also have problems with "commission", only giving it one "m" sometimes.

      I'll got with fraught, suburb, and miniscule too.  
        
      I always have to look at the word "thorough" twice... there's a certain irony to that I suppose.

      Drum roll, please....And the winner, who even spelled "minuscule" correctly, is MARIA! (I always thought "mini," but now I'm trying to think "muinute.")  
        
      About the word judgment: Most people seem to add the "e," and while I've always thought that wrong, I looked it up just now and it is an acceptable spelling.  
        
      So, Maria, don't fear our "judgment" or find it at all "embarrassing" if we question your "commitment" to an "antidisestablishmentarian," assuming that's a person. Tee, hee.

I remember being chastised by my gifted & talented program teacher for spelling 'expirement' instead of 'experiment.' More often, however, I have trouble when I am seeing the same word over and over, and I become convinced that it's spelled wrong. This gets especially problematic at work when I'm stocking the seasonal greeting cards. Most recently, I've become convinced that DaySpring has misspelled 'Father' on all of the backcards for the current promotion!"

      katy - since you are a writer and wordsmith, I figured maybe you would be able to help with this bizarre word question. I was unable to find anything on it, and it was the topic of discussion at dinner this evening.  
        
      The question is, what is the plural verb form of lightning. For example: "Wow, it is really thundering and lightning(ing) out there." That just sounds and looks wrong. But lightninging is rather humorous to say. Perhaps it is just a bad sentence to begin with and should be "Wow, there's a lot of thunder and lightning out there tonight."  
        
      Anyway, sorry to post a question in a comment box, but thought perhaps you or your readers would be able to help.

      The following is a matrix poem for your consideration of "Words" This poem, written by me, was dedicated  
      to UNICEF as children are the most important things in this world. If you read the first letters, from each  
      line downward, as well as the first letters from the last words (capital letters), you will find an extra message.  
      If you like the poem -- please pass it on. If you don't like the poem, please pass it on.  
      Stardust (a matrix poem)  
      M ight we have seen a star, and thought about Y ou and I,  
      A nd considered life, and what space we could O ccupy?  
      N o remembrance for wealth, as death comes in U ndertow,  
      Y et your quest remains money, not the golden R ainbow!  
      C hildren dying of hunger, who dies, you help to D efine,  
      H ell on earth they must endure, they have no O utline!  
      I f it would be your children, suffering this N eglect,  
      L iken to a nightmare, would this change your A spect?  
      D ogmatic judgements, life on this earth, our T enure,  
      R ebuke these foreign, their Stardust must be I mpure!  
      E ven if most do agree, some may come with an O utcry,  
      N ot every child equal, some deserve to get a N ecktie!  
      D oes our wealth give us a right, our will to I mpose,  
      O r are children our real riches, what do you S uppose?  
      S o many children die already, due to lack of N utrition,  
      T his horrible fact, will not make the Sunday E dition!  
      A mid this mindless rebuttal, will their time E xpire,  
      R each with your heart, and is this your real D esire?  
      V isualize children with pain, a donation can E ffect,  
      E very child needs love, the future, yours to D irect!

      Joshua, How I wish I could be of help. But I have gone even further with the lightninging problem. It must not have sounded quite homorous enough for me, because I actually hear myself saying, "lightningning"--with another n in there! Pathetic, huh?  
        
      Bridget, Minute, minuscule. Yes. We shall overcome!  
        
      John, Thanks for sharing.

      Gah, I corrected your spelling?? That seems unnecessarily snobby of me. :-P Sorry about that!  
        
      I'm one of those people for whom spelling has always been very easy...I don't know if it's some innate genetic capability, or if it's the excessive amounts of reding I did as achild. Either way, I think I'm slipping...I've found myself misspelling the simplest of words lately. It took me four tries to figure out how to spell "weather" the other night.Maybe I am just getting old.

      Bethany, Please don't misunderstand! I want to have my spelling corrected. I can't stand to think I've misselled a word for God and everybody to see. You did me a kind service!  
        
      About your problem with the ravages of advancing age, I am unable to help. Tee, hee.

      I depend on my spell checker for catching my mastakes. It automaticaaly changes thinks like thier.  
      Of course you could always affect an ultracasual style and include alternate (alternet) spellings of words you aren't sure of.  
        
      I have two other problems: I leave out words, things like a and it and you, little words that get lost somewhere between my brain and my fingers.  
      I also have this select group of words that my fingers mix up. I know the right word. I think the right word, but again my fingers have a different opinion. The best example is think and thing.  
      Careful reading before I hit 'post' would solve the problem but then I would have to read what I wrote and I'm afraid it would sound hopelessly lame and infantile.

      too bad bill g. hasn't found a way to develop a checker that covers both spelling and context. a strategically misplaced or displaced letter can change an entire word. my biggest spelling blunder involved turning in a western civ paper my sophomore year in college where i had used the word "public" but had forgotten the all important 'l'. ahem...  
        
      \[incidentally, the word "sophomore" has always caused me grief. i tend to leave out the 'o' in the middle.\]

      fraught(like caught, not fought), suburb(think sub urb"an"), superb, miniscule(think mini, small)  
        
      One word that gives me problems, and that I misspelled in a spelling bee in H.S. is parallel. I hope I got it right this time...Lol.

Several words have been causing me spelling difficulty lately, and interestingly--to me, at least--they all contain the letter "u."  
  
Without looking it up, would you vote for "fraught" or "frought"? Sometime ago, a reader corrected my spelling (and since I am the type of woman who gives credit where it is do, her name is Bethany), but even now I can't remember which way is right.  
  
I would know the answer to this next one if I stopped to think before I write, but that's not going to happen in this lifetime. So which one should I have used a couple entries down? "Suberb" or "suburb"? (And what about the fine distinction between "superb" and "supurb"?)  
  
Since those were a giveaway, here's another. I used this word twice in the novel I wrote, and even though several people have read (with a critical eye) the final version I submitted to the contest, only my sister Mary caught it. Should I have written "miniscule" or "minuscule"?  
  
Don't look it up! Just give me your off-the-top answers. And while you're at it, what words cause you a particular problem?
