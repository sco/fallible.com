In November of 2001, I did NaNoWriMo for the first time.

For any of you who don’t know about National Novel Writing Month, it’s a recurring adventure in which participants attempt to write a 50,000 word novel in a one-month period.

I’ll tell you what: I wrote the World’s Crummiest Novel that month, but I kept my BIC (Butt In Chair) and got the words down, even managing to come up for air long enough to do a turkey and all the trimmings for the fam. Plus I was going to school full time. And my mother’s health was beginning its precipitous decline, demanding a ton of my attention.

But I did it. The next year, I did it again. And then I began to write a “real” novel, and at some point along the way, abandoned it. THEN I wrote the first full-length novel that I actually finished, the one that landed me a great agent, Rachelle Gardner of WordServe Literary.

But still no publishing deal, boo-hoo. Oh, wait. That itsy-bitsy crying jag was not nearly demonstrative enough to show my true feelings. BOO-HOOOOOO and WAAAAAA! That’s more like it. You might as well know how I really feel, right?

Now, with this new book, I’m doing something that never crossed my mind with My Lawful Wedded Life. I’m plotting. And getting to know my characters rather well before much of the actual story is written. And constructing a timeline for the novel, not to mention a timeline of how many words per day I need to write if I’m going to complete it in my natural lifetime.

But those things are largely done now. And here it is, coming up on November 1. I’m afraid I may have prepped myself into a corner and it’s possible I’m losing my nerve about writing the story. So I think I’m gonna go down the NaNoWriMo road once again. What have I got to lose?

Fifty thousand words from now, I’ll most likely have some stuff I can really use and then I can build upon those elements and get this story written. I’m absolutely in love with the tale, and hoping I can execute it in a way that even approaches what I imagine the novel can be.

Anybody else gonna give NaNo a run this year? If so, let me know in the comments section. Maybe we can say a prayer for each other. Lord knows, we’ll need all the help we can get.
