      Katy,  
      Rob and I are in different places at the moment, but on St Patrick's Day he sent me this text "Ta' me' chomh doitre sin diut". He is not Irish I assure you. Gotta love a man who knows how to make you smile.  
      Blessings.

My husband, an incurable romantic, couldn’t stop himself this morning from telling me how gorgeous I am. I know, I know. Get him a new prescription for eyeglasses, right? In the meantime, I decided to enjoy the moment and compliment him right back.

“Oh, yeah?” I said. “Well, you’ve got a physique like a Greek god.”

In true fallible style, he hesitated for only a second. “You mean....broken off in parts?”
