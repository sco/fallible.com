      You need a daily reading Bible...trying to read it cover to cover never works...We have a couple of the bibles designed to be read in a year..they give you a little Old Testament, a dash of New...a bit of Psalms and Proverbs each day...  
        
      We at least kept it up thru a portion of September last time we tried.  
        
      This year we vowed to do it all the way through together...out loud..  
        
      So far we're 16 days behind....sigh.  
        
      Maybe 2006

      My reading schedule does not have a deadline. I use an online version from Bible.org and read when I read the blogs that I read. I'm a numbers freak so I do track what I read. It helps me see where I am and how far I have progressed. Last year I completed reading the Bible in eleven months.  
      Of course it isn't the speed at which you read the Bible, it is with how much passion you receive the words.  
        
      Take Care

      OK. All three Michaels have now weighed in on your topic in consecutive order. At the moment my favorite verse (conveniently) is "and the last shall be first." In elementary school we would be differentiated as Michael M., Michael O. and Michael \_\_\_ . Maybe there is a Michael P. and a Michael R. lurking out there. One never knows with our ilk. But we are everywhere, like Tribbles on a starship.  
        
      I'd like to think of us as the 3 wise men. If the others are anything like me it is more likely The 3 Wise Guys.  
        
      Anyway, a blessing on you Katy for affording Doug his time and space. It's wisdom. Remember that anthem from the 60s? (You might have read about the 60s in your hisroy books) "If you love something then set it free. If it comes back you'll have it forever. If it doesn't return it was never really yours to begin with."  
        
      Something tells me once Doug won't be wandering too far from home--even if he finds his keys and wallet.  
        
      Doug, enjoy the day off. Even God took one. Katy, you are right about "Skipping Genesis." I think it's a great title for a novel.  
        
      BTW, when does Doug give you a day off?

      It's funny what you feel like you can say in this forum/format that you might not feel comfortable saying otherwise. Anyway, here goes... There has been (for me, at least) an unexplainable satisfaction in having read the Bible through a multitude of times. I wish there were a way to say that without sounding bragadocious. How about if I confess that I am lousy at memorizing? And I will readily confess that what started me reading it through was reading that set of books that used to be found in doctors' offices. Though we had no children at the time we'd purchased the set and I promptly read the whole thing. (BTW, the kids never liked the books :)) Even with a strong Christian/church background I was impacted as a twenty-something by chronologically reading the stories of the Bible. All this just to say that you don't have to wait to start again next year. Start with Exodus now. I use the Old, New, Proverbs, Psalms schedule also and have for some time. And I totally agree that it doesn't have to be accomplished within one calendar year. Have a "Bible year" - however long it takes, as long as it takes.  
      Sorry to be so long. Just wanted to encourage you in a worthy endeavor.

      Greetings, Three Michaels and an Anne!  
        
      All of your advice on Bible reading is truly helpful. I've got a One Year Bible, which I tried one year...It's like if there's a date on the top of the page, and I'm running behind, I get frantic. And then I quit, at least as far as attempting to read systematically goes. Often, though, the feelings of failure have kept me from picking up a Bible for some weeks afterwards... :(  
        
      That said, I have read the whole of Scripture many times, just not systematically. And definitely not ever chronologically!  
        
      I think I'm going to try the online version, and consider it something I do while I'm engaging in blog reading. Maybe that will take it out of the realm of "that dreaded Bible-In-A-Year book that makes me feel terrible every January"! Doug is doing this this year and he's stayed on track.  
        
      Michael O--Doug is thoroughly enjoying the no-nag zone! I'm about to feed the man a steak dinner with loaded potatoes and Red Lobster-style cheesy-garlic biscuits. Oh, yeah. He's happy...

      I'm doing the online plan this year.  
        
      So far I am 8 days behind, but I prefer to think of it as having only 8 days extra to read before I'm caught up.  
        
      Perhaps I need a good nag in the house.

      My Bible reading comes in great big bites every so often. Not the best way to digest my daily bread, is it? I find myself yearning to read a whole book at times, so I finally made it through the minor prophets last year by indulging those cravings.  
        
      I don't have a problem with Genesis, but get bogged down with Leviticus and Numbers. What I need is a great commentary or study that will give me a reason to read all the way through those books 'cause I know there's a purpose to their inclusion in the Good Book but it seems quite hidden at the moment.  
        
      Maybe once I get the habit of taking a daily vitamin down I'll feel confident enough to tackle daily Bible reading. And I'll have enough Vitamin E going through my system to help my brain remember to stick with it!

      Rebecca--You know what's weird? I don't have a problem with Genesis, either! I thoroughly enjoy Genesis (unlike Leviticus and Numbers...). What stops me in my tracks is the whole "falling behind" thing. Isn't that dumb? I stop taking vitamins sometimes for weeks at a time, and then I start up again without feeling any overwrought sense of failure. Same with exercise...I'm on again, off again, but at least I'm persevering! (Right now I'm on again, so that's good...)  
        
      I want Bible reading to be the same way...I'll probably always go in spurts, but the spurts would be a lot closer together if I didn't allow myself to "feel guilty" or whatever. Thanks for your input--I'm gonna keep plugging away at this!

      I decided to ask the Lord (don't I sound spiritual) what He wants me to read. So, I'm in the Jo books: John and Job, where I read about victory and stress!  
        
      I laughed out loud at your decision to naggeth not for a day. Perhaps, perhaps, perhaps I should heed your example and do the same...  
        
      Gotta go...hubby needs some correctin'

      Mary--The Jo-Jo plan sounds as good as any to me! (And the being led by the Lord plan has got to be a winner...)  
        
      I committed to co-exist peacefully with my hubby in the no-nag zone for 24 hours, ending at midnight last night. I did really well until about 10:30 pm, and then the pressure started to get to me.  
        
      I almost blew a fuse with him over a couple of life's trifling details, the kind of trivia that keeps me awake at night, but managed to reign in my urges! Then, upon awakening this morning, I found--much to my surprise!-- that I seem to have broken through the nag-cycle-from-hell I'd gotten caught up in. Today, I haven't had the urge to bug him AT ALL!!!  
        
      He's not quite himself, though. A bit disoriented, if you ask me. Rootless, meandering through the halls muttering to himself...it's pitiful, really. But so entertaining! :) If you think of it, pray for him...

      I am also a "great" authority on Genesis, and for me, the "falling behind" thing is also a huge factor! I've already messed up this year as well. When you find the solution, let me know.  
        
      One thing I heard that may help us since we like to read: Read the Bible before allowing yourself to read anything else each day. That means no opening the emails and no peeking at blogs until the Bible program has been opened!  
        
      I need to practice that advice.

      Cindy--Yeah. These Dougs of ours should stick together! Try it, and let me know what you think... :)  
        
      Lori--I may try this. It's the only approach that works with me where exercise is concerned. If exercise happens, it happens first thing in the morning, before I even let myself have COFFEE. That way, I have no memory of the whole unsavory affair, but I still got the good out of it. So maybe, right after exercise, I could read the Bible WHILE DRINKING COFFEE, because I DO want to remember the Bible reading....  
        
      We wannabe-faithful-Bible-readers need to keep encouraging one another to find a way that works for us! Thanks.

      Hi Katy,  
        
      You guys are so funny!!! I can easily picture Doug in his aimless wanderings. Much like our Dad did after Mom came to the Lord and decided that Dad needed to lead the household. Dad hadn't a clue how to manage! Don't tell Doug I mentioned anything that seems to say "like father, like son?". :)  
        
      As far as Bible reading. Last year I decided to try a One-Year Chronilogical Bible. Its been a fascinating way to read - being able to place the prophets in the time frame of whats happening in Israel and Judah.....reading the letters that Paul wrote along with Acts in their appropriate timings. Ok - so its Jan 19th and I'm on Dec 26th - but 13 months to read thru the Bible isn't too bad!!  
        
      Much love to you both,  
      Nancy

      Thirteen months is GREAT, girl! I'm really impressed...  
      I didn't know your dad very well, but I suspect there is a "like father, like son" component involved here! Your poor father must have been shaken to his core to be crowned "the head of the house." So funny!

      katy, i have also tried unsuccessfully to start that read through the Bible in a year plan, always pooping out soon after beginning Leviticus. I had a big desire again this year, though, and really think that God is helping this time. First, our pastor led a Sunday school class on the history of the Bible - how did the one we read today come into being? Interesting stuff..and ended with a discussion on versions. Through that, I decided to shelve my trusty NIV for awhile and delve into a NAS. I asked him, since that old New Years resolution was creeping up on me - if there was a one year Bible out there in my new version. He recommended using Our Daily Bread's through the Bible in a year program, so I committed to that. After reading through Genesis with a little trepidation, I was happy to see that the next book wasn't Exodus, but Job. I think, though there is definitely value in chronological reading, I will have better success this way. Good to read your and others' experiences with this issue here...I want so much to make reading God's Word a gathering and ingesting of daily bread, too. It had already made a huge difference in my life this month. Press on, sister!

As I mentioned a couple of weeks ago, I'm not much for New Year's Resolutions.  
  
I tried again this year--against what I know to be true and pervasive about my weak-willed character--to commit to a daily Bible reading schedule. I got twelve chapters into Genesis before falling irrevocably behind the ambitious schedule, which happened by Day Three. It's taken 34 years or so, but I've become a certifiable expert on Adam and Eve, Cain and Abel, Noah's Ark, and the Tower of Babel.  
  
Next year, I've resolved, I'm skipping Genesis (Hey, wouldn't "Skipping Genesis" be a great title for a book?) and starting fresh next January 1 with Exodus and the baby Moses. That way, by the time I die, I might at least have two books under my Bible-Reading-Schedule belt.  
  
In the meantime, I've hit upon an idea which may not cause me to fall into undue consternation about the depth and quality of my Christian dedication: New DAY'S Resolutions. Like a bona fide twelve-step devotee, I'm going the route of "one day at a time, just for today."  
  
So this morning, to my husband's utter amazement and delight, I pronounced today Dougie Raymond's Day Off. For just one day, I committed to my husband that he would enjoy 24 hours without spousal nagging, reminding, correcting, and directing.  
  
It's two in the afternoon now. We've been home from church for a while, and Doug's wandering aimlessly through the house like a sheep without a shepherd. He'll be OK, I think, if he can just hang on for another ten hours...  
  
But what if my commitment to stop nagging should extend itself into the morrow? Can our marriage survive such a dramatic change in dynamics? Or will Doug Raymond shuffle off into the sunset without his wallet, keys, and cell phone?  
  
Any guesses?
