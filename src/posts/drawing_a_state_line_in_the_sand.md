      i did fine driving at a crawl on our icy rural 50 mph road last night that connects our little town with topeka, ten miles away...that is, until some clueless guy behind me decided he was in a big hurry, ice or no ice. i don't really have full blown road rage, but my irritation grows from mild to moderate when i'm forced to share the road with..what's the word i can post here...NINCOMPOOPS. there, that felt better :).

Mine would say everything from \"Excuse me, the light is green\" to \"Learn to drive or JUST STAY HOME!\" I guess I could just carry a bullhorn in the car..."

![The path less traveled...](http://www.fallible.com/snowplow.jpg)The snow storm last night wasn't so terrible, but it happened on a Sunday. Apparently, road crews were observing the Sabbath.  
  
Kev did fine on his 30 minute run to school this morning, except for the 10 minute stretch of State Line Road. We live 30 seconds from the State Line that separates Missouri from Kansas. It's a road we travel daily. Kev called from school to say State Line was a horrible mess of snow and ice, and that he was nearly involved in several accidents, as numerous cars careened out of control.  
  
Doug and I ventured out a few hours later, with no problems at all until we hit the State Line. Then we saw how right Kev was. Snow removal trucks drove up and down the road (some on the Kansas side of the middle line, and the others on the Missouri side), all of them with their blades up.  
  
No unsavory elements were being removed from the road. Navigable paths, such as they were, had been created by crawling traffic only. The turning lanes in the very middle of the road (Kansas or Missouri, who can tell?) were so treacherous as to be useless, causing even greater hazard as drivers attempted to turn left without using these lanes.  
  
We commiserated all the way home how neither state's road crews would claim the responsibility for clearing State Line, and how dangerous were the results of municipalities behaving badly. The citizens of both states deserve better.  
  
I've always known there is no middle ground. Now I'm thinking that even if there was, what good would it be if you couldn't drive your car down it?
