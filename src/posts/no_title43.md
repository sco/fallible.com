Once a couple of years ago, when my dear friend Bruce called to tell me he was (most likely) dying, the only thing that could make its way out of my mouth was, \"Well, phooey!\" And Bruce, a former priest and brilliant philosopher, responded, \"Phooey is right.\" Sometimes, it's just right, Annie. Your mother is wise. xox"

I am on a kick of collecting neurologists, and I always hesitate to consult with a new one, and always for the same reason. I'm afraid if they examine my head, they'll know what I'm thinking, kind of like a psychiatrist who also tests your reflexes. Next week I'll visit my umpteenth neurologist on Friday, and a neuro-opthamologist on Wednesday, just for good measure. Should be like killing one bird with two stones. If I'm lucky. Soon, I'll get it through my thick skull that the only way they'll know my feelings and fears and foibles is if I tell them. And the only way that's gonna' happen is if one of them manages to put me under some kind of anesthesia where I blab everything... Oh, phooey. I'll let you know what they find out.
