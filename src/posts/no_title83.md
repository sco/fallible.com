Sometimes I think of the young woman I was in 1977, the one whose eyes opened like slits as the effects of general anesthesia were just beginning to subside. The one who saw her mother standing there and announced, in her most dignified voice, "I have something of extreme relevance to share." Mother moved closer, gently stroked my face and asked, "Well, then, what is it?" She was answered with a sound snore. I think of the young woman, and wonder. Do I still speak what must be said? Do I still write what must be written? Do I still have something of "extreme relevance" to share? Or do I just jolt people awake with my snore?
