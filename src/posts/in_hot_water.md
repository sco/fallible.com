![Bath Party](http://www.fallible.com/img/bath.gif)Ever since we finally got a satellite dish a couple of weeks ago, I've been glued to the Fox News Network, which I philosophically prefer for its "fair and balanced reporting." You know the saying: "We report; you decide."  
  
Sure, we do.  
  
For hours each day, it's nothing but "Baath Party" this and "Baath Party" that.  
  
The only thing we've decided is to put in a hot tub.
