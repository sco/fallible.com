I was seven when I first heard  
of Mother’s Day and thought,  
How lovely for my mother  
that my teacher has us doing crafts  
at just the exact right time.

Miss Evans passed out bars of naked  
Sweetheart soap, pure white,  
the kind my mother bathed the baby with,  
and used to scrub her nylons on Saturday,  
the night before Mass.

I wrapped the oval bar in golden rick-rack,  
cut from spools at the Five and Dime,  
overlapping the ends. Then I used straight pins  
(Be Careful!) to poke in purple plastic violets  
on top, like a field of flowers in the snow.

I punctured my fingertip and it bled  
onto a pale green leaf and I didn’t  
wipe it off with a Kleenex from my bookbag.  
Because Mom needed to know  
how dangerous love can be.

She treasured that gift more than life,  
setting it on the windowsill away from water  
where lowlier bars bathed new babies  
until only tiny fragments of soap  
remained in the old chipped dish.

I emptied my mother’s house one day  
and there sat my decades-old gift.  
Dust and grime engraved upon the violets,  
the rick-rack petrified, straight pins rusted,  
the bottom cracked and dry.

I thought of the little girl with  
the young mother and the old woman  
now bathed by others with a fresh bar  
of Sweetheart soap.  
And I cradled it carefully in my hands.
