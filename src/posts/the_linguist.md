      "What did you study?" "Economics and Chinese." "Do you speak Spanish?" "No." "So you speak Chinese and you moved to Peru?" "Well..."

      Peter, The first time I looked into Scott's face, he had an expression that said, "What were you thinking? Is this it? There's got to be more..." Seriously, he looked like "Scott Raymond, Baby Adventurer." Your friendship with Scott is an enduring one, and I thank you. Love you, Pete!  
        
      Tim, Oh, man is right!!

"He has a degree in linguistics," I say, when people ask about my oldest child.  
  
But what does that mean? they say.  
  
"I think it's the study of how the mind processes language, or something like that."  
  
What does he do with it? they persist.  
  
"That's easy. He's [Scott Raymond, Gentleman Adventurer](http://www.scottraymondgentlemanadventurer.com/)."  
  
And then, just to be annoying, I ask how they use their degrees.
