      I think we're both on the same track. I'm totally avoding doing my work today, too. I have a presentation tomorrow and don't want to work on anything. My head is pounding (obviously that epideral shot two days ago was a waste of time), and I've shut down. So, I'm reading blogs. So much for work today...

I'm struggling to get an article written. It's for Today's Christian magazine, a piece they requested about the girls from Northern Ireland who stayed with us for six weeks during the summer of 2001. We loved Sheryl and Chloe like they were our own kids, and the time they spent with us was priceless. The next summer, though, Sheryl and her sister Tara were killed in a car accident.  
  
I probably haven't dealt with this too well. I'm reading back through their online journals as well as my references to them here on my blog (mainly in the archives of July 2001 and July 2002, if you're interested), looking for material I can use in my article and bawling my head off.  
  
Doug is keyed in to my emotions, and thinks a fancy coffee beverage might help.  
  
"I'm ready to go to Starbucks anytime you are," he says.  
  
I, on the other hand, am committed to my writing. "But wouldn't that be an avoidance behavior?"  
  
"Yeah, but what if, by not going, we're avoiding *Starbucks*?"  
  
When he's right, people, he's right. We're outta here!
