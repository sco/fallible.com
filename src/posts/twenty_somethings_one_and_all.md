      What a great set of parents. I can't imagine the emotional rollercoaster raising kids will be, but it is something I look forward to. In the future. In a decade. No sooner, God, please. Thanks! Ha!

      Katy, your kids are so blessed to have you & Doug for parents. My mom once told me she was grateful she only had me & my bro coz if she'd had just one more child we'd all have definitely driven her insane! I think I was in my teens at the time...  
        
      Of course, she's also the one who told me I was the 'guinea pig' coz I'm the eldest. \*rolls eyes\* But I know she loves me :)

      Awesome, Katy. I know how Doug feels. I mean, I really do. Sally and I got pregnant at 44 and 46 respectively and now are 16 years from the last H.S. graduation.  
        
      Actually, that's the subject of the book I'm working on.Which I promised to tell you about. And I will, but I'm hoping to do it offline because it's far too long a story..  
        
      Did you guys get the email I sent last week from the link on Doug's site? Have your people call my people.

      I hate to argue with such a gracious and lovely host, but I have two boys that already have the top honors of being the best kids in the world.  
        
      Take Care

      What blessed children you have! And I agree totally. Raising kids is the best, most valuable, most satisfying thing my husband and I ever done. And we've got years ahead of us yet - our oldest is 13 and our youngest only 9.  
        
      Happy birthday to your baby!

      Not sure how serious he was, but adoption sure would be a wonderful thing to do for an an orphan who could really use a family.

Tonight, at midnight, Doug and I will reach a milestone (not a millstone) in our marriage. At the stroke of twelve, we will officially resign from the duties and responsibilities of raising teenagers.  
  
Our baby, Kevin Patrick, turns twenty tomorrow.  
  
It's a more bittersweet feeling than I imagined it would be. When I told Doug this was our last day of parenting a teen, his response was one I never expected, especially since we hadn't ever seriously considered his idea when we were younger.  
  
"Let's adopt," he said.  
  
And you know what that tells me? It tells me that my husband, just like me, considers raising our kids to be the best, most valuable, most satisfying thing we've ever done. So much so, that we'd almost entertain the notion of starting all over again.  
  
Did I mention that we have the three best kids in the world?  
  
Happy Birthday, Dear Kevin...
