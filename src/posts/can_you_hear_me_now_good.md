      My mother recently got tested and found out that she really needed the hearing aid that we'd all been suggesting for years.

I hear perfectly in one ear, but am totally deaf in the other due to brain surgery. Sometimes, I pick up the phone to the wrong ear and tell my husband it was a hang-up call....I'm the one with the hang-ups!!"

![Can You Hear Me Now?](http://www.fallible.com/megaphone.gif)"So, what have you been doing?"  
  
My 81-year-old mother-in-law had called to talk to Doug, who wasn't home, so we chatted for a few minutes. It's not easy talking to her over the phone, since she's deaf and I can't hear.  
  
"I'm actually working on a deadline," I announced, in my loudest and clearest voice. "I'm editing a novel."  
  
"Oh....." she said. "You're going to be a model...."  
  
The poor woman. First deaf, now completely blind.  
  
"I wish you luck, dear!"  
  
Supportive, though, isn't she?
