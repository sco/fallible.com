    text: "Anne--Yes! I realized this morning that I've not taken the time to get to know David that I need to. I like him, because he makes it easy to. But he's a little bit of work to know, because he's not very demanding. He's not complaining about his life like the others are, so I have to pull info out of him. Until I know him, though, he keeps refusing to get very involved in the story. A stubborn streak, I'm thinking. Since I'm the one he's stuck with to be his \"typist,\" I'm going to make the investment of time and effort necessary to find out what makes him tick. I have to! You've helped me."

      Consider this my pre-order of your novel.  
      \-----

So I'm writing this novel. Why did I imagine that I already knew these characters, and that they would just start doing stuff and saying stuff and I'd take dictation? When you know people, after all, don't you almost know what they're going to say before they say it? Or, if they're exceptionally unpredictable, you can at least be sure they're about to do or say the exact opposite of what you should be rightfully able to expect--right? I swear I've never met these people in my life. Before I can predict what they're going to do or say, and before they'll feel comfortable enough around me to let loose, we have to get to know each other. In the real world, that can take a while. One thing for sure: Christie, David and Julie are a threesome, and I'm an interloper. I hope they learn to trust me soon.
