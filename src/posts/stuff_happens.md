      That might be one of the funniest stories I've ever heard. Thank goodness someone's teeth are firmly in place!

We'd only been in this hotel room on Sunday night long enough to unpack and pile into our jammies when Doug crawled into bed with stiffer breath than usual.  
  
"I can't believe we got here without our toothpaste," he said. "But I made it work."  
  
I kept my mouth shut, both because I hadn't brushed my own teeth and because I had a sorry suspicion about what had just happened to his.  
  
"I dipped my brush in that little container that says 'Mouthwash.'" he said. "It worked great."  
  
It's too bad that before he dipped and brushed, I had dumped and flushed. Instead of mouthwash, the plastic bottle now contained hair spritz.  
  
So now my hair's all fuzzy, but at least his teeth are held firmly in place.  
  
They're all his own, too.
