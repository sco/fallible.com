From the archives of September past: "I can assure you," says the wife of Tom Burnett, one of the passenger heroes on the hijacked plane that crashed in Pennsylvania, "that he was not calling me to whisper sweet nothings, or to reflect on his life..." What could be more extravagant than imagining that you, in the hour of your death, will be afforded the luxury of time standing still, so that you might have a few moments to reflect upon your life? Reflect today, tonight, this hour. Repent if God is calling you to repentance, and then rejoice when your heart is right with Him. But don't delay. Who knows what might be asked of you in that hour, the hour of your death? Who knows whether courage might override reason and whether you, instead of fleeing to save your own life, might rush headlong toward eternity to save another's? Today, if you hear His voice, do not harden your heart. Because tomorrow, there may be no time left to reflect.
