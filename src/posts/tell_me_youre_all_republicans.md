      Even I, with many more Democratic than Republican values running through my blood, remember how much I trusted and respected Reagan. He was like a father-figure somehow. Our country needs more leaders like him...

      What a lovely tribute. Honestly, President Reagan was the first I ever admired, respected and, sadly, grieved for. I never understood how people could admire Kennedy so much until Reagan made such an impression of integrity on me.  
        
      Though he has been drifting for years, he will be truly missed.

Back in the good old days, when Ronald Reagan was president and character was king, I was just a young Republican. I'd already had a short, regrettable stint as a Democrat, with disheartening results.  
  
I'd voted for George McGovern as a hippie-wannabe eighteen-year-old, and stayed up all night with a bunch of drunk friends watching the election results come in. We all thought the world had ended when McGovern lost, and I considered opting out of the whole process right then.  
  
I voted in a more informed, thoughtful way for Jimmy Carter. Even now I believe that Habitat for Humanity is one of the best causes around, so that's something. Still, I've worried a bit about my latent capacity for committing adultery in my heart ever since he admitted he'd done it, even though he was a decent enough man not to tell us with whom.  
  
It's hard to turn away from Republican philosphy when the first--and greatest--one you ever had the privilege of voting for--twice--is Ronald Reagan.  
  
Doug and I were poor new parents during the Reagan years. I'm not sure it could be said we prospered much under his tenure, but we believed it was possible, and that was something. Our taxes weren't cut a bit, since we barely earned enought to pay taxes, but the "trickle down effect" of a strong economy caught up with our little family eventually.  
  
The fact is that we were so poor during most of Reagan's administration, we consistently fell below the poverty line. We easily qualified for food stamps, WIC (free food for women, infants, and children under age five) and maybe even a little Aid to Dependent Children. We probably could have gotten a brand new federally-subsidized apartment in the suberbs for a buck a month if we'd applied.  
  
But we didn't apply, not for any of the perks to which we were so clearly "entitled." We decided that the good taxpayers of this land had not compelled us to pop out three kids on one inadequate income--we'd done it of our own free will, and in good conscious, we couldn't ask for the handout. As the months went by, instead, we learned ever more about why God made bootstraps. And guess who provided a wonderful example?  
  
Ronald Reagan.  
  
We enjoyed the less tangible but more impressive benefits of living in a country in which our leader refused--out of respect for the office he held--to remove as much as his suit coat within the Oval Office.  
  
In essence, we grew up.  
  
If you think those weren't the days, think again. And pick up a couple of papers today. Perhaps they'll print a few of the seven hundred essays the Great Communicator penned in his own hand, on virtually every subject under the sun.  
  
And if you think you can't miss what you never had, I'll have to disagree. Ronald Reagan is missed by all, even by those who don't remember.
