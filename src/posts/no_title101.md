    text: "Jonathan--I think I started locking my doors when we built this house, and I couldn't see any other houses and there are no street lights and it was so completely PITCH BLACK at night, that it was a little frightening. Then I started keeping them locked during the day as well. Now, I'm just plain not scared."

I am a person who, as a matter of high principle and personal security, locks all the doors when I'm home alone. Even during the day. This morning, just to fly in the face of sound judgment on a fabulous spring day, I purposefully left them unlocked. Without even stepping outside, my spirit soared.
