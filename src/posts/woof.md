    text: "My baby LOVES dogs. She says \"dog\" at least 5 or 6 times a day and we don't even have a dog. So, for her 1st birthday (in about 2 months) its gonna be a Dog Day ;-D. Please don't say she won't remember, because I'd have to beg to differ. I remember my 1st birthday and her Dad has early memories, too."

"You can say any foolish thing to a dog, and the dog will give you a look that says, 'You're right! I never would have thought of that!'" Dave Barry
