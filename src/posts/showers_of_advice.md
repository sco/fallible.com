      two of my favorite pieces of advice we received from a recent couples shower given to us at church:  
        
      \-remember to cook in every room; not just the kitchen.  
      \-(for my soon to be husband) never tell her she's just like her mother.

      Do not open your mouth simply to switch feet.  
        
      Or something.

    text: "Nothing small is worth a big fight. It IS okay to go to bed angry, just don't forget what you're angry about so you can talk later. Have different hobbies, but similar interests. Know what's best for each other. Respect one another. Have faith."

    text: "Say yes to each other whenever you can. There will be plenty of times when you have to say \"No, I really don't want you to do that\" or \"No, I really don't feel comfortable with that decision.\" If you save your no's for when you really feel strongly about something, they will be more likely to honor your feelings on the subject than if you are constantly bucking them."

      let love and faithfulness bind you; let your sense of humor never be lost; don't take yourself too seriously; remember we are all (you AND your signifigant other) but dust, sinners in need of grace, and selfish control freaks to some degree. oh, and..love covers over a multitude of sins.  
        
      (happy shower going..i know i've been to a slew of them already and it's not even june yet! ;)

      TK, is that you? I'm so honored! Doug has done what you've advised, and while he's had a few problems, they haven't been serious! Tee, hee.  
      Thanks for reading and posting, my dear friend!

I'm invited to several wedding showers this summer, at least one of which will be for Brooke, my son Scott's fiancee. Fun, huh?  
  
I'm betting that before the summer's out, I will be called upon, along with millions of other shower-bound women, to give the bride a piece of salient advice on marriage.  
  
You know the drill: "Never go to bed angry." "Communicate." "Squeeze the toothpaste from the bottom." And my personal favorite, "Never wash the fiberglass drapes in the same load with the underwear."  
  
My least favorite piece of marriage advice, and one we followed religiously until we rebelled about a year ago: "Never have a TV in the bedroom." Guess what we found out? You can have a TV in the master bedroom and, just as if it was in any other room in the house, *you don't have to turn it on*! Who knew?  
  
Help me out here, guys! (And girls, of course.) I want to win the shower prize for the best bit of advice! What's your favorite? Or do you have one you think is a stinker?  
  
All advice appreciated!
