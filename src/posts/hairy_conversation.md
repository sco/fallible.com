    text: "C--I've never found the ones you mention! Tee, hee. I think I must be partial to poetic sounding phrases that start with prepositions. OK--now I'm laughing. I started to type \"propositions\"!! You've created a monster! My favorite right now is \"As We Forgive Those,\" which is a working title for a project I've started.<br><br>Shawn--Oh, please go back to your former manner of reading, lest I am held accountable to God for this! Tee, hee."

I wake up talking a mile a minute. He stays up late at night, and usually stays in bed at least an hour later than I do in the morning.  
  
It's 6:30. I'm already reading him news stories about car bombings at the Marriott in Jakarta (where Scott may be going) and a girl who got killed in the parking lot at Wal-Mart (where I will be going).  
  
He snorts and snores in response.  
  
After regaling him with how dangerous the world is, I tell him that I thought of a great title for a book yesterday--one that uses my favorite titling technique, that of the "biblical half-phrase"--and that Amazon showed only one other book by the same title.  
  
*"Not A Sparrow Falls,"* I say. "What do you think?"  
  
"Good title!" he says. Now I've got his attention for the day. "Much more poetic sounding than *"He Numbers the Hairs."*  
  
Nothing wrong with my guy that a little Avacor wouldn't fix.
