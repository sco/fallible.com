      Beautiful, Katy!  
        
      My mother is in the NH with Alzheimer's and I seem to be the only one now who knows or cares about her stories. Regretfully, my only sibling was my sister who died at birth before I was born. My mother never talked about her but I think she might have in later years. I won't know now, so I'll just have to meet her in heaven.  
      Thanks for your beautiful poetry today!

    text: "Debra, Even when our parents become demented, they are often--I think--telling true stories. Maybe not factual, but still true. You are blessing your mom and yourself by being there and listening! And you are so right---there are some stories we won't hear until heaven. There's a bittersweetness to that, isn't there? I try to tell myself that every time I'm with Mom, we're writing a piece of a new story, one I'm telling even now....Bless you."

RememberingÂ nothing,Â   
IÂ amÂ hisÂ keeper.Â   
FeatheryÂ wisp,Â tingedÂ withÂ faintestÂ auburn,Â   
YellowedÂ cellophane,Â   
FadedÂ page,Â   
MildewedÂ book.Â   
OneÂ   
FingerÂ   
TremblesÂ   
TouchingÂ hisÂ hair,Â   
LongÂ decadesÂ unmussed.Â   
TuggingÂ itÂ onceÂ more,Â   
LikeÂ theÂ babyÂ IÂ was.Â   
DidÂ heÂ laugh?Â OrÂ cry?Â   
OrÂ payÂ meÂ back?Â   
HeÂ died.Â   
OneÂ   
TearÂ   
FallsÂ   
Glistening,Â shimmering,Â   
OntoÂ myÂ brother"sÂ lock.Â   
OntoÂ this,Â   
MyÂ inheritance.Â
