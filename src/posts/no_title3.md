My characters are not me, of course, nor are they anyone else in my life. They started out being close cousins to me and other people I know, but they've taken on their own lives now, have personality traits I don't remember assigning them, and have quirks and motives downright dissimilar to the characters I'd planned. Still, when the story arrives at a turning point for one of these people, and a new revelation surfaces that uncovers why they act as they do, it has the vaguest twinge of familiarity about it. And so I wonder how much we can authentically write of lives we don't know, of feelings we've never had, of motivations we've never been tempted by. They say that all the main characters in your dreams are really you. That if you dream of your father being a little too hard on you when you were a kid, you're really trying to resolve your own tendencies to criticize your children. Who knows? Maybe all these characters are me. And maybe after the novel's done, I'll go ahead and schedule some time with a good therapist. I think I'm suffering from Multiple Character Disorder.
