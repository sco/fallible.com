But it's always a great joy when I'm able to. :) The answer is 42 .. from Douglas Adams' 5-part trilogy. I do the forget to close parenthesis, too. And I wanna pre-order your novel as well. :)<br><br>God bless ya!"

      Beautiful, Katy. I know exactly what you mean.

I've been thinking a lot about how our "religion of origin" stays with us for a lifetime. When I was a child, I was taught that one is to receive the communion wafer into one's mouth, let it partially dissolve, and swallow it without chewing. To defile the body of Christ by allowing it to come into contact with teeth or lips or jaws was considered sacriligious. I must admit I've done my share of gossiping, back-biting and believing the worst (aloud) about my fellow members of the body of Christ from my earliest memory. I can chew them up and spit them out, and sometimes feel pious in the process. Funny, though. I still handle communion as carefully as the first time I received it. I'm praying the day comes when everything I do with my mouth will be done in remembrance of Him.
