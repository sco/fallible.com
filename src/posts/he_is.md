"Are You the One? Or shall we look for another?"  
  
Poor John the Baptist. Who can blame him for second-guessing whether or not Jesus was the Messiah, when he--arguably Jesus' greatest promoter--had been thrown in the slammer by King Herod for speaking up against unrighteousness?  
  
Was this how it was supposed to go for John? Was this God's plan for his life, that his head end up on a cake plate at Herod's birthday party?  
  
John was willing to give up his reputation and even his God-ordained ministry for Jesus, if that's what it took. Hadn't he said, "He must increase, but I must decrease"?  
  
Sometimes, though, in the process of laying it all down again, you end up asking the hardest question of all, just to be sure.  
  
"Are You the One? Or shall I look for another?"  
  
"The blind see, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, and the gospel is preached to the poor."  
  
He's still the One.
