      You're only overindulging if you then ate it.  
        
      I'm sure that's in the rules somewhere...

      Lisa, More weird than wonderful? Some days...  
        
      Irene, What color was your shirt?  
        
      Les, Did you say "trails" on purpose, instead of "trials"? A freudian slip perhaps? It was quite a trail...  
        
      Tim, You can laugh.

You know you're overindulging when, at the end of a long day of writing, snacking, and having the weird feeling that there's a creepy crawling thing inside your shirt, you remove your clothing and find a huge hunk of chocolate in your bra.  
  
Sugar-free, of course, but still.
