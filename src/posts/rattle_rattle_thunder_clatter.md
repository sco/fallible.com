      So, hopefully without negating the thought and insight that you put into this wonderful quote, Katy, I thought I'd run it through an Ebonics translator and give you a new one:  
        
      "When writing uh book fo' da God fearing peeps, fight preachin' it. Instead o' axin' 'What should dis here peep do or spit next?' force yourself ta ax "What would he do or spit next?' If ya begin ta pen what should happen, don' trip, dog. You will find out dat ya iz wronng sho 'nuff. The death rattle o' uh the dyin' word makes uh really flippin' sound. Brace yourself foo'!"

    text: "oh gosh...all kidding aside, that's really one of the best things i've heard said about writing. it's an adage that many existing Christian writers should wish they'd heard before they got published. i feel like stitching it on a pillow. if i ever write a book on writing (that is, if i ever write a book on anything, thereby qualifying me to write a book on writing), i want to quote you. or maybe you should write your own book on writing; you're a far better candidate than i."

Quote on writing by Katy Raymond, which she sincerely hopes other writers will wish they'd said first:  
  
"When writing a novel for the Christian market, resist the urge to preach. Instead of asking 'What *should* this character do or say next?' force yourself to ask "What *would* he do or say next?' If you begin to write what *should* happen, don't worry. You'll recognize the gravity of your error soon enough. The death rattle of an expiring story makes a truly frightful sound."
