Just a thought, but I know that, combined with blood pressure pills, helps Jim. Glad the worst is over...thank God for good drugs (and husbands) when we need them! :)"

Saturday morning's headache started like they all do--I hopped out of bed.  
  
All the literature about the dumb condition I have, Pseudotumor Cerebri, warns against sudden movements, but every morning, without fail, I forget.  
  
By two in the afternoon, I was back in my jammies and had crawled under the covers. I'd taken four migraine pills to no avail, and a couple of Tums for my upsetedness. By five, I whispered (no noise above a whisper could be tolerated) to Doug that he'd have to take me to the ER.  
  
You know those advertisements showing a neo-natal nurse, surrounded by screaming babies, holding her temple, wondering how she will survive her shift? And how her doctor prescribes Imitrix, and now she can go on?  
  
This one made me pray for that kind of headache.  
  
"I'll help you get dressed," Doug said, knowing my propensity for modesty.  
  
"Just get me to the car," I moaned. He did.  
  
I've always wondered what degree of migraine it would take to have to get pumped full of Demerol. Now I know. They kept me for four hours, drugging me into a much-needed delerium, although Doug says I was pretty much delerious before we left the house.  
  
He got me back home by nightfall. and eased me into my bed. No sudden movements.  
  
As I lowered my head onto the pillow, I saw it. There, beside my large, half-full and therefore extremely loud-to-operate plastic bottle of antacids, sat one purple Tum on the table.  
  
Hours earlier, when I was horribly ill, he had done that for me, sheltered me from the sound.  
  
"You love me," I said, fingering the Tum. He smiled.  
  
It was the smallest thing he could have done. It was the one I won't forget.
