      so, what did you end up watching? i'm watching "sense and sensibility" tonight with my mom. we're on a jane austen kick. we watched (all of) "pride and prejudice" a couple weeks ago, and she watched "emma" last night. it's quite fun.

A couple of half-way interesting movies were on TV last night, during the same time slot. "Let's do Armageddon," said one of the kids. "No," I answered, "we can do the end of the world any time." Did I say that?
