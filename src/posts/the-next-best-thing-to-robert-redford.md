Today, my friends, Robert Redford turns 75 years old. To celebrate, I’m breaking out a recipe that is at least 35 years old, if not 40. My mom made this a million times and we never tired of it. I’ll give you the recipe exactly as she’s written it. It does not get better!

          The Next Best Thing To Robert Redford

1 cup flour  
1/2 cup softened butter  
1 cup finely chopped nuts  
8 oz cream cheese  
8 oz Cool Whip  
1 cup powdered sugar  
1 box instant chocolate pudding  
1 box instant vanilla pudding  
3 cups milk  
grated chocolate for garnish

Cut flour into butter with a pastry blender until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Mix in nuts. Press into the bottom of a 9 x 13 pan. Bake in a 350 oven for 30 minutes. Cool. Mix together cream cheese, 1 cup of the Cool Whip, and powdered sugar. Spread over cooled crust. In a large bowl, combine choc pudd mix, van pudd mix, and milk. Stir until thickened. When thick, pour over first 2 layers. Cover with remaining Cool Whip and garnish with chocolate. This will keep, covered, for up to 2 weeks in refrigerator, or may be frozen.

Trust me, this WILL NOT keep up to 2 weeks in refrigerator!! Enjoy!
