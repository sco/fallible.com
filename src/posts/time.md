    text: "Tim, Thank you. Sue did die--not that night, but the next afternoon. Her husband of 30 years, her 22-year-old daughter, and her 18-year-old son surrounded her in the hospital room. They were all watching the Royals game, holding onto my friend for dear life. The four of them fell asleep (having been sleep deprived, I'm sure), and a short while later, only three awakened. Sue's daughter said her mother died exactly the way she wanted to. Even so..."

      Kristine, You are very kind.  
        
      I, Thanks. My husband is the hanging basket designer and webmaster.  
        
      Annie, Time and even death (which feels so final) are fleeting in the brilliant face of resurrection! I SO miss you, dear girl.

"But I thought," said my lifelong friend Lori, "that we had all the time in the world."  
  
Our friend Sue is dying, not like everyone will die, someday years from now. Our friend will die tonight, if not before. It is not a matter of time anymore. It's become a matter of eternity.  
  
This can't be happening, we say. We've only known each other since yesterday, when we were all fourteen, and newborn and clean and freshfaced. All the universe unfolded before us then, neverending in its possibilities, as if we were at its center, and not it at ours.  
  
God and all His creation were at our command in our unspoiled youth and, because of the indelible memory of that time, somehow even still they seem to be.  
  
We know it isn't so. We are not naive.  
  
We've learned too little, perhaps, but experienced too much to cling to hopes of never ending innocence.  
  
We know we cannot squander time, and yet we do so with abandon, as if we were merely fourteen and a day, instead of what we've certainly become--women on whom time has played its sneaky trick of switching sides.  
  
"The gravest of all human errors," I answer, "is to believe we have all the time in the world."  
  
I hear the words of wisdom leave my lips, and yet we stubbornly believe our friend will not really die tonight.
