      I'll tell you what: My MIL was blown away! We sat at the dinner table at Doug's sister's and took turns reading poems aloud. Then when the party was breaking up, Adele was still sitting there reading away. She'd been awake the whole night before, she was so excited about getting her books!  
        
      It was a most gratifying occasion. Thanks, all.

My mother-in-law, Adele F. Raymond, who turns 83 years old tomorrow, is about to become a published author.  
  
Oh, she's had some poems printed in her local newspaper in Massachusetts during WWII, but nothing much since then. She even worked in the offices of Popular Science Magazine before she got married in 1949 and started raising her family.  
  
But then, life kicked in. The family moved a few times before settling in Rome, NY, where they stayed until 1970. When my father-in-law, Jack, accepted a transfer to Kansas City, she packed up the house and joined him here. Jack died of skin cancer the year Doug and I were married, in 1977, and Adele joined the workforce once again. She's retired now, of course, and we sold the family home last year. Adele has a lovely apartment in a retirement community, where's she's making new friends and keeping the old.  
  
For as long as I've known her, Adele's written poetry. Most of her poems are about her love for the Lord, and His goodness and faithfulness toward her. She loves to include a typed copy of one of her poems when she sends birthday cards to her friends and family, so I'd read quite a number of her creations over the years.  
  
But not all of them. None of us had read all of them until we asked her to pull them from boxes and scrapbooks and computer files. That girl's been holding out on us!  
  
As I write this, I've got one eye on my long, winding driveway. Today, and soon, the UPS guy (one of my favorite men in the world, right up there with Santa Claus) will deliver a cardboard carton containing sixty copies of Adele's published book of poetry--a gift from her children for her birthday. Now she can give autographed copies of her entire bound collection to all her friends!  
  
Adele knows about this, because we wanted to involve her in decisions about cover art and poem selection, and she is thrilled! As a still-unpublished book author myself, I think I can say she's going to get a huge kick out of this.  
  
And I'd just like to say, no one deserves it more.
