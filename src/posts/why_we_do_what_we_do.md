      I don't know the answer.<br><br>I do, however, think that our occupations--no matter how short or long linved--do not occur randomly, by accident.<br><br>But what I do know. I'm gonna be a shrink.

I've got years of experience in everything from Surgical Assistant to Web Designer.<br><br>What I really wanted to be - a writer - was something I was told ALL my life was a waste of time. Not a good living. A pipe dream. Somehow, all those lies seeped into my brain and now, everytime I place my fingers on the keyboard I hear the horrid words that I am wasting my time. I write only at night, when everyone else has gone to sleep and all my chores are done.<br><br>So, long story short, I think that my career was chosen for me by God, derailed by the good intentions of others who had plans for my life and somehow, in the big scheme of things, I will be who and what I was meant to be. In the meantime, I'm enjoying the experience for what it is."

    text: "I think perhaps the method of discovering one's vocation is unique to each of us, as are our vocations themselves. Some take standardized tests and discover it, some seem to hear the voice of God (and who knows how that works, really?), and others of us come upon it seemingly accidentally, though I agree with Maria that it's not really an accident. For some of us (um, me), it just needs to seem that way for awhile before we can accept it."

Against the skepticism of my family, friends, and myself, I am majoring in theology. I was all prepared to major in public relations, something I think I would probably do well in, but theology is what I truly wanted to do. Despite the fact that I still get asked \"So ... what are you going to DO with that?\" and don't have an answer, its wonderful to realize that this is where I'm supposed to be--and I love it."

I'm fascinated with the subject of how people decide what to do with their lives.  
  
Do people tend to arrive at vocational conclusions accidentally?  
  
When I got out of high school and didn't enroll in college (somehow, the ACTs slipped my mind...), I signed up with an employment agency. The first thing they found that matched my complete lack of education and skills and could keep me in macaroni and cheese, I took. I ended up keypunching orders for a pharmaceutical company for five years, the very type of work for which I am, shall we say, tempermentally unsuited.  
  
I kept getting reported for writing poetry on the sales order forms, and designing greeting cards for fellow office-mates on company time. It was sad.  
  
Or do people depend heavily on the opinions and direction of those they've come to trust, like high school counselors and even parents?  
  
My guidance counselor might have edged me toward French, but what did she know? Today, all I can say is, "Brussez vos dents!" (Brush your teeth!). I've saved a little in dental bills, but still. I would have had a hard time carving a career out of it.  
  
My dad might have used his connections in the industry to find me an entry level job in banking, but I was kiting so many checks when I was eighteen, I don't think he had the heart. Besides, he had his reputation to think of.  
  
Is it some cosmic combination of childhood traumas, random compliments, faint praise, and heredity that leads us to our life's true purpose? For those who make it a matter of prayer, how does God let them in on His secret?  
  
If you know the answer, or even part of it, I'd like to know.
