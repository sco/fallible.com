      Romance is awesome.  
        
      Purely out of curiosity... When a woman starts down the road of "my (insert bodypart here)," as in this case, is she really fretting or is she chumming the waters for complements (knowingly or subconsciously)?  
        
      Once in a while I hear the same type of thing from my loving girlfriend. Most of the time I've got enough wit about me to respond as your husband did. On my off days, I'm clueless, as I hear men frequently are.  
        
      Anyway, good luck with your nails, and congrats on the romance! :)

      Women are funny about this stuff. If they're feeling really good about themselves (and you can pick up on that through their body language, etc.), they might just be fishing for compliments, which isn't a sin in my book...  
        
      On the other hand, if they have something of a distorted body image or a few quirky insecurities, they may just need a little kind reassurance of their mate's love.  
        
      One thing I've realized over a long marriage (and wonderful romance!) is that Doug is hurt if I'm always putting myself down. He is of the opinion that he chose a beautiful, skinny, smart and talented chick, and if I'm always whining about myself, it's like I'm saying to him, "News flash...you've got crummy taste in women!"  
        
      The last thing I would want is for him to believe some of the stuff I say about me!!  
        
      All the best with your romance, too!

      Devastated once more by viewing other comments while stuff's still loading in this reply window... Yipe.  
        
      Basically, thank you for the insight. The rest was just words. (And I used to be a good writer once...)

So Doug's out of the shower, dressed, and shaving. I round the bend into the bathroom, studying my crummy-looking nails as I go. When I catch sight of myself in the mirror, I let out a small scream.  
  
"I look awful!" I say. "My nails, my face, my hair, my body..."  
  
He pulls me in for a hug.  
  
"Stop," he says. "I love your face, your hair, your body..."  
  
"What about my...?"  
  
"I don't think so much about your nails."  
  
We're having a really good day.
