      I'm sorry about the former, but as to the latter... Whatever. :)

      I don't know whether this will help, but I just quoted you in one of my posts. I loved what you had to say on holding on to one's first love:

      :) Have I ever told you I love your way with words?

      Irene, How are you, girl? Thanks. I have found that being quoted in other blogger's blogs does indeed relieve the horror of migraine and the heartache of fat. Tee, hee.  
        
      Tim, "Whatever." Whatever? That's exactly what Doug says. ;)

Typical conversation in the Raymond household, when I am recovering from a horrible migraine and feeling emotionally insecure:  
  
Katy: "Do you love me at all?"  
  
(Doug laughs the wonderful, self-assured laugh of a man in love.)  
  
Doug: "You know I do."  
  
Katy: "Yeah...I know."  
  
(Kissing happens, during which Katy begins to feel slightly more secure.)  
  
Doug: "I love all of you. I love all y'all."  
  
(Katy's insecurities regain their foothold.)  
  
Katy: "Now I just feel fat."
