Well, except for the catheter thing in recovery. To me, that was worse than any needle. (Isn't that a happy thought?)<br>It will go well, Katy.<br>Anne C."

      Bravo on this one! Don't worry...the needle's not too bad...think of everything else you've been through. This is nothing! :) (Yeah, I know, easy for me to say..)

So. I've been to both the neurologist and the neuro-opthalmologist in the past week. They agree that I have swollen optic nerves, but both characterized the level as "subtle." At this level, my vision is not in danger, but my spine is feeling more threatened with every passing minute. I gave birth to three children (the girl among them a 10 lb. 5 oz. bundle) without benefit of an epidural, out of a belief that women were intended to endure pain in childbirth, and I wanted to experience the blessed events in full measure. Ha! I was scared to death of long, freaky needles being inserted into my spine as much then as I am now. A spinal tap has been nevertheless scheduled for next Monday, a necessary step in the diagnostic morass I now find myself in. The most likely possibility of the things they're looking for is a condition called "pseudotumor cerebri." It's like a brain tumor, symptom-wise, but you've got to admit it sounds fake. What kind of a sadistic namer of new diseases would use the term "pseudo" for something real? With pseudotumor cerebri, you get all of the pain, with none of the perks. All of the coping, none of the casseroles. You get my drift. It's typically a woman's disease, which explains a lot. If I ever get a crack at naming a man's disease, I think I'll call it "Impotent Neurosperm Dysfunction." It'll serve them right.
