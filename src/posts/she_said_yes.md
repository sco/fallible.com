      Beautiful. I delight in seeing couples in love--I get all gooey inside from seeing and feeling all of that lovey-dovey energy.  
        
      I'm such a mushball.  
        
      I hope you had a great Easter.

      No mater how long you court someone there is always that little voice, you know the one, the rotten little voice that says they don't care like you do.  
        
      Anybody that gave a ring and knew the answer already, had a more timid conversation at another time.  
        
      Here is a question, does it take away from the magic of the moment if she helps pick out the ring?  
        
      Is the surprise part of the magic?

"Let's take a walk through the park, Gertrude," said one old woman to the other. "It's bound to do us some good."  
  
The evening was cooler than they'd anticipated, coming as it did on the heels of a sunny April afternoon. If they'd been any younger, they might have walked faster. But if they'd walked any faster, they would have missed it.  
  
"Look, Mildred, over there..." She pointed at the couple in the rose garden. The girl sat on a bench, facing the young man who stood beside her. Suddenly, to the great delight of the women, the man dropped to one knee.  
  
They stopped walking then, since even time and all of creation seemed to stop in its tracks, and waited with something like reverence. They shivered, first of the increasing cold, but perhaps even more as they remembered other young men with similar lights in their eyes. Men now decades gone, but who still had the power to make Gertrude and Mildred feel young again with just a fleeting thought.  
  
The young man held out a ring, and placed it on the girl's finger, and she must have said something, because he beamed a smile that reminded them for all the world of Gertrude's beloved Henry and Mildred's dear Cecil.  
  
The old women grinned then, joined arms, and headed for home, but not before the bride-to-be heard one of them say to the other, "*[She said yes](http://jacobswellchurch.org/blogs/brooke/archives/000660.html)*."  
  
The evening had warmed considerably in a few moments' time, and Mildred had been right, as usual. Their walk had done them a world of good.
