    text: "Yes. So often I wish that I could speak with the clarity, care, and confidence with which I write.<br><br>I think, however, that writing is generally an activity done in solitude, without external pressures. Conversation, to me, anyway, usually feels pressured and hasty (especially when I am presenting a patient to the attending phsycian!), and I feel like my tongue is rolling along MUCH faster than my brain.<br><br>Drat that."

    text: "Maria, Unfortunately, when I speak, my brain sometimes refuses to become involved at all! It checks out and lets my mouth play the fool all by itself. Sigh.<br><br>Bethany--Of course, you read it right the first time. Sometimes, I think of my 18-year-old as way more of a kid than he is."

"It is dangerous to leave written that which is badly written. A chance word, upon paper, may destroy the world. Watch carefully and erase, while the power is still yours, I say to myself, for all that is put down, once it escapes, may rot its way into a thousand minds..."  
\-William Carlos Williams (courtesy, this morning, of [http://www.scottraymond.net](http://www.fallible.com/index.php?URL=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.scottraymond.net))  
  
"You keep an online journal?" the classy red-haired lady asked. We had just been introduced at a party, and were hitting it off. She's the type of woman you tell intimate details of your life to in the first five minutes of your acquaintance and then afterwards ask yourself, *What was her name?* I'm thinking I'm that type of woman, too.  
  
"It's like a diary?" she wanted to know.  
  
"Sort of," I said. "I write about little stuff that happens on a typical day, and give my take on it. I avoid any topics of a highly personal nature--"  
  
Did her face fall with disappointment?  
  
So she and I talked about subjects of a highly personal nature, comfortably, with my eighteen-year-old son standing right beside me, eyes wide and rapt with attention.  
  
I got to thinking later about William Carlos Williams. Not him, exactly, but the idea he presents in this quote. Sometimes I wonder if the care I take in editing my written words wouldn't be put to better, and more eternal, use pre-screening my spoken words. Those are the ones that get me in trouble, the ones I so often wish I could take back.  
  
This morning, I'm wondering how many of my spoken words, once they've escaped, have rotted their way into a thousand minds.  
  
Still, there's nothing wrong with my mouth that a good Editor couldn't fix.
