      I've missed you, Katy! I've been pulling my hair out wondering where you've been! :)  
      Really, I have been looking forward to each new post.  
        
      By the way, I used to work with Kevin at the Raph.

I cannot believe how long it’s been since I posted here at fallible!

Suffice it to say that a LOT’S been going on, and sometimes a girl just gets overwhelmed.

But just to show you how much I love you and to let you know that there are good things still to come from Old Reliable Fallible, I am giving away not one but three hardback books to three fortunate commenters.

Leave a comment---maybe telling me that you’ve missed me!---and you’ll be entered in a random drawing to win either Kathy Ireland’s “Real Solutions for Busy Moms,” or Dave Ramsey’s “Financial Peace Revisited,” or Leanna Ellis’s fun novel “Lookin’ Back, Texas.”

The first name drawn will get first choice, the second name second choice, and the third name will get the final book. Sound like a good time? I’ll give it a day or two, and then my impartial drawer of names, aka Doug, will do the deed.

I promise if you get to commenting, I’ll get back to my regularly scheduled blogging! I really, really will.
