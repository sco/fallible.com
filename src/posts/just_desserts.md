![expiration date](http://www.fallible.com/brain.gif)Kev had been doing a little comparison shopping from the sounds of it.  
  
"You know," he said to the two of us, as if he'd just gotten a heavy revvie, "you guys look pretty good for being fifty and forty-nine."  
  
"Yeah," I said, "and we're mentally with it, too."  
  
He hesitated a split second too long, his face a little too straight.  
  
"So far," he said.  
  
That's what I get.
