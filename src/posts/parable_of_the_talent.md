      If a few of you guys could leave a comment here to let me know you're viewing my current posts, that would help me. A reader wrote than my recent posts were "gone." Evidently, I have even more technological issues than I knew! Thanks.

Man, do I identify... \\*grin\\*"

![Unraveling...](http://www.fallible.com/img/thumbnails/unraveling.gif)Just for starters, I'm not technologically, mechanically, musically, or electronically inclined. My husband and kids are *all* that and a large, green Rubbermaid container full of cables besides.  
  
Science isn't my thing, and neither are computers, which leaves me out of Doug and Scott's conversations. I'm happy for them, though.  
  
I can't share Doug's bedtime passion for physics books and heady tomes on intelligent design, relativity, and expanding universes. So much for our love life.  
  
My personal experience with sports has been so limited that my idea of a sports injury is a blister. I recoil from balls, bats, clubs, pucks and sticks, and that's just when I'm in the bleachers. I can swim, but only well enough to save my life--and even then, I'd have to be in the mood.  
  
My thumbs are not green, and I always figure if I recover before the houseplants I receive when I'm hospitalized die, it's a certifiable miracle.  
  
I don't live to cook--I cook to live. When Carrie assembles ingredients for her homemade cinnamon rolls or Kevin wants to impress the girls at school with a batch of his truffles, I hightail it out of the kitchen. Let's just say they're self-made chefs.  
  
If I have a flat on the highway, I'm out of luck. We've got another new cell phone, and it's being mystically counter-intuitive about what it takes to turn it on.  
  
Around the time the war coverage began, Doug thought getting a satellite dish was a great idea, so I went along. Now he tells me over and over that I'm not making any progress with the remote because I've got it on "TV." Since that's *exactly* what I'm trying to watch, what concept am I missing?  
  
Somehow, though, against all odds, I've managed to learn to sew, embroider, needlepoint, quilt, and crochet. That sounds a little impressive, except that my husband and kids tend to lump together these unique talents (which require completely separate, highly developed skillsets) and label them, as an entity, *knitting.*  
  
  
I wouldn't mind that they've so readily condensed my lifetime's accomplishments into a single word, really, if only I could knit.
