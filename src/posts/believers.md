      Interesting site. Appreciate the tongue and cheekiness of it. By the way, if one takes the position that all things are fallible, then isn't that position wrong?

      Chip, I'm glad you're here, but a little intimidated after clicking on your site! BTW, I believe quite a number of things are absolutely true. I, though, am apparently incorrigibly fallible. Sigh. (Actually, my hubby saw a list 3 1/2 years ago in Time Magazine, I think, of the remaining one-word domain names still available. The second we saw fallible on the list, we jumped on it. For some reason, he felt it suited me perfectly. ;)  
      Thanks!

    text: "Chip, I never would have noticed. Katy is one of those names that's usually spelled the other way! I am recovering from my earlier intimidation. There are a few pastors who check in here, and my first sorry inclination is to try to be \"good\" if I think they're lurking. Eeeewwww. Sick, huh? Thanks."

      Please...first I am a former pastor...second you have GREAT material. In fact you'd be perfect (although fallible) for dropping in to my own weblog (In the Margins) and to contribute to Habits--once the site is fully launched.  
        
      NO lurking here...peace, chip

Sunday nights were always the same at our house when I was a kid. Dad cooked steak on the grill winter and summer--rain, snow, or tornado.  
  
One night just after I turned ten was different, though. Dad, who usually lingered at the table with a newspaper and coffee, was the first to finish and head for the TV room.  
  
"Youse people get in here!" he shouted, his Scottish brogue thick. "You won't *believe* this!"  
  
Mom and I and my two younger sisters ran in to find the Ed Sullivan show turned up full blast, and Dad pointing and laughing hysterically at the four mop-tops shaking their healthy manes.  
  
Forty million people tuned in that night, and many of them--like my dad--never quite made the leap to "true believers."  
  
But from the first moment we saw them, my sisters and I believed with all our hearts.  
  
February 9, 1964. Forty years, and yet it seems like *Yesterday*.
