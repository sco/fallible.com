I haven't led a life of faithlessness, but I've had my moments. Many of those moments have happened recently, catching me unaware, ganging up on me until they've begun to accumulate into hours, and sometimes entire days. But always, the very thought of God consoles me, the remembering how unlike me He is--how faithful He is. For even if we are faithless, He remains faithful, the Scripture says. And He is not just faithful in a generic, impersonal way. His faithfulness extends even to me, the doubting one. The very thought of Him brings me back to the truth: I do believe.
