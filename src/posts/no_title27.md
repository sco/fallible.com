I jotted this impression to myself two weeks ago. As soon as the movie ended, I became ill enough to need five days in the hospital: Doug and I may watch the movie "Iris" tonight, the story of the English novelist Iris Murdoch and her eventual decline with Alzheimer's. I'm a little worried about the theme, am not sure I want to witness the diminishing of Murdoch's gifts right in front of my eyes. Maybe it's that I know I'll be confronted with making sure I'm using the gifts I have, while I have them, and while it's still called *today*.
