      Anyone know if chicken has the same chemical in it as turkey? Definitely had chicken today instead.

I woke up this morning thinking about how much I love blogging. And the thing I love the most about it is my wonderful readers. Thanks to each and every one of you for stopping in here, for sharing your thoughts, and for making this so much fun for me.  
  
Hey, if any of you who have never commented would like to say "hi," I'd love to know you're here!
