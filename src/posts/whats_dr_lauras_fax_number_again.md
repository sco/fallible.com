      LOL That could be a page out of my diary, the dialogue is spot on.

      He called you back to bed and brought up Dr. Laura? :)  
        
      I'm going to remember the next time Amy accuses of me of being unromantic...which will likely be within the hour if my track record holds.

      Jennifer--I'm so sorry about the dialogue of your life! Tee, hee.  
        
      Michael, Ummm...I'm the one who brought up Dr. Laura. My husband is VERY romantic...I think I'd better change my ways, huh?

    text: "Irene--Husbands are funny guys. Just when you think they aren't paying attention, they come up with proof positive that they are! I think I can predict what Doug will do or say next, and I often set him up with something I say just to hear him say what I know he's going to say. (Kind of like making of move in chess, already sure what the other guy will do next.) Only every once in a while he fools me, and it's great fun. He could fool me more often, but he knows how much I enjoy his predictability, too, so he holds back.... ;)"

I was up early this morning, checking my usual online news sites and a dozen or so blogs while the coffee brewed.  
  
Doug, however, wasn't ready to be in the bed alone.  
  
"Come back," he said, patting the spot in the bed that he thought I should occupy. "Just for a few minutes."  
  
I crawled in beside him long enough to offer him a free thirty seconds of therapy. "Dr. Laura is right, you know. Men's needs are so darn simple."  
  
He patted me on the shoulder a few times and kissed my forehead. "But you're complicated," he said.  
*  
What does that have to do with his needs?* I thought.  
  
"Um...yeah," I said, and then to clarify, "but your needs are simple."  
  
"Yeah," he answered. "But *you're* what I need. And you're complicated. So, you see, that makes my needs *complicated*."  
  
Even Dr. Laura couldn't argue with that logic.
