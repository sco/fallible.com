Mom & Dad said it encouraged us to look forward to Christmas for the wrong reasons and they didn't want us to be materialistic. I wish they weren't so practical and logical sometimes! (Practicality means no Christmas tree & Christmas decorations, too)"

      Carrie, See how much you can raise for your missions trip, and then we'll talk. I'd rather buy you gifts for Christmas if it works out!!  
        
      Irene, I knew a guy once whose family wouldn't celebrate birthdays because they didn't think anyone should have that much personal attention. Question: How well has your parents' strategy worked, overall? Did the kids end up antimaterialistic? And do you look forward to Christmas for the right reasons? Parents try, they really do, but sometimes we can get goofy. As my kids--they can tell you some great stories...

    text: "Well, it's ended up so that I don't look forward to Christmas at all coz it doesn't feel like anything special, just another day (although of course technically I know it's a meaningful day and all). As for being anti-materialistic, my brother is the stingiest person I've ever seen -- he'd rather patch things up than buy new ones -- but money goes through my hands like water. I indulge myself too much because I figure if nobody's gonna pamper me, I might as well pamper myself! All in all, I don't think my parents' strategy worked exactly the way they wanted it to... \\*grin\\*"

    text: "Irene, Yeah. I figured something like that happened. Parents try, we do. But we are notorious for screwing up. Too bad adult children so often end up having to spend their inheritance on therapy! I hope you have enjoyable and meaningful holidays this year."

I'm heading out to do a little Christmas shopping. It's a challenge at the moment, because we're having, I'll just say, significant cash flow difficulties. Doug and I have agreed to not spend what we typically would on each other this year, but he's feeling bad about it.  
  
"I love you," Doug says, as he's hugging me good-bye, "and I just want to give you much more."  
  
"Ooohhh," I say, "that's really sweet, but I don't want much more."  
  
I say it in a way that clearly means, "I have everything I want already."  
  
"So," he says, eyes twinkling, "just a little more?"  
  
I've been set up.
