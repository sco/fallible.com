      reminds me of michelangelo, who said that when he was sculpting, the sculpure already existed inside the marble, and that he was not \*making\* it but "setting it free", merely brushing away the excess material. "beauty is the purgation of superfluities," he once said.

I've been thinking about how in art class you learn that white is the presence of all color. So, a white canvas starts out with every color and every painting already represented there, right? The artist's job is to use the brush and the individual colors to transform everything into something--something new and unique and personal. I feel the same way about writing. The blank page doesn't frighten me, or intimidate me. The only thing wrong with it is that there's just too much there. So I start with one keystroke, and then two, until the everything begins to become nothing more than background for the distinct, new something. Until the everything becomes the true thing, the thing that must be said. I'll never be able to understand everything, or even to cast my eyes upon it for long without needing to make merely something out of it. Just one word, two words, three words at a time. Suddenly, the white page isn't everything anymore, and some might think that's a pity. Still, it's something. It's something.
