      Heartbreaking. I don't know what else to say except that I can't even imagine. I will try to remember to pray for her for the next week.

      Done.  
        
      May she feel God's presence around her, always, and be lifted up.

      i prayed for her today...that God's presence will be bigger in her life even than this enormous pain and void. that His love would fill it and overflow out of it, that He would be her comfort, strength, and when she is able, her song. i cannot imagine either...i just know that He can do anything, and that He loves us all so much.

I haven't mentioned this much here, because it's just been too painful to write about.  
  
On April 16 of this year, our good friend [Butch Lombardo, along with his two adult sons, Guiseppe and Nino](http://www.fallible.com/2004_04_01_archive.html#108298919656374686), were killed in a car wreck. Butch's wife and the boys' mom, Cindi, was home cooking dinner for Guiseppe's birthday when the call came. She is the sole survivor in the family.  
  
This family was one in a million, a city set on a hill, shining for the glory of Jesus. All four of them shared an amazing passion for touching the hurting, reaching the lost, feeding the hungry, and seeing the captive set free.  
  
Cindi Lombardo still does. She holds Bible studies in her home, ministers to a group of young women who are sharing her house, and accepts speaking engagements as often as she can, telling others about her wonderful men, their beautiful hearts, and their readiness to meet their heavenly Father.  
  
You probably don't know her, but would you take a moment to pray for Cindi over Thanksgiving, and then again if you think of her? And please pass this request to anyone you know who might want to pray, as well. She needs to be held close in the Lord's arms...
