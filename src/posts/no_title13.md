      hey i had candy cigarettes fairly often when i was a kid - and i'm only 18! :) i'm not sure if they still make them, though. my sister and i were just reminiscing about them the other day.<br>also cool were the cigarette gum sticks - about the weight and size as a real cigarette, but made out of bubblegum wrapped in paper. the cool thing was there was white powder - not sure what - flour? - inside the paper, so when you put the cig to your mouth and blew, "smoke" came out. that was awesome.<br>i have fond "neighborhood" memories too...like being threatend with a bb gun by the neighborhood punks. ah, good times. (actually, they really were)

      <br><a href="http://www.burgundywinevarieties.com/">Burgundy Wine </a> lies at the very heart of France, and is one of the world’s finest wine producing regions. Located two hours to the southeast of Paris, the wine area starts in Chablis in the north of the region and then it follows the autoroute A6 southerly to Lyon.  
        
      The Burgundy soil is mainly based on oolitic limestone, upon which both the Chardonnay and Pinot Noir grapes flourish.

You've got to be pretty old to remember candy cigarettes, but I do. So now you know I'm not a kid anymore. Candy cigarettes were the confection of choice for children of smokers back in the late 1950s and early 1960s. There was no such thing as a surgeon general's warning back then. For all I know, there was no such thing as a surgeon general. Political correctness hadn't been invented yet, and if it had, my parents would have passed it up in a heartbeat. Why buy into a philosophy guaranteed to make everyone miserable by denying them their ciggies--candy or otherwise? Candy cigarettes were so popular they often appeared in the spilled-out Halloween bags of pre-schoolers, in convenient treat-sized packs of three Lucky Strikes each. A kid could always count on getting a stash from the Angelos, the Perkins, and the Mahoneys and on good years, the Hedricks and the Ramms. During the rest of the year, a standard pack from Katz Drug Store held twenty smokes, just like Dad's, but people tended to cut back a little for Halloween. (And, it should be noted, during Lent.) We lived in the middle of a long block of small bungalows in 1959, next door to Patty and Karen, and not far from the twins, Mary Janice and Mary Jeannette. Way up the street lived Dennis "The Menace" Van Buskirk and way down at the other end lived Pamela "The Pig" Murphy. Under no circumstances were we allowed to go past the Van Buskirk's house on one end or the Murphy's on the other. And as you might have guessed by their nicknames, we didn't often venture too close to their houses, either. (At our next house we had Scary Larry and his wolf-dog "Baby" to deal with, but that's another story.) My five-year-old sister Lizzie was a bully, and not frightened like I was of Dennis the Menace and Pamela the Pig. Lizzie spent much of her time on the outskirts of our boundaries, making life for those on the edge as hair-raising as possible. One day, she decided to show Pamela the Pig, who was hanging out on the corner smoking cigarettes with all her juvenile delinquent friends, what was what. Lizzie took off for the corner with her brand new pack of candy cigs in hand. She planted herself squarely in front of Pamela the Pig, demanded the attention of the whole gang of hoodlums, and said, "Hey, look at me, Pamela the Pig! I'm smoking, too!" With that, she puffed sophisticatedly on her stick of candy. Undaunted, Pamela the Pig pulled her lighter out of her pocket, sneered, lit the end of Lizzie's candy, and set it dripping into a puddle on Lizzie's saddle oxfords. Lizzie bawled all the way home, but never regretted taunting Pamela the Pig. In 1959, that's what neighborhoods were for. Wouldn't it be great if things were still so simple? If you could still get away with naming your enemies, calling them what you named them right out loud, and standing up to them even if they were five times your size? And wouldn't it be swell if they could still curl their surly lips and light your candy on fire to pay you back? The older I get, and the more hemmed in I feel by political correctness, the harder it's getting not to miss the good, old neighborhood, and candy cigarettes.
