Okay. I just want to let you know that yesterday I passed the 60,000-word mark on my novel-in-progress. That's about 220 pages, double-spaced.  
  
The contest I'm entering has a deadline of February 1, leaving me a full (and otherwise extremely busy...) three months to finish the first draft and revise. The finished book can be as short as 50,000 words so, believe it or not, I might actually finish!  
  
That's just so unlike me in every way.
