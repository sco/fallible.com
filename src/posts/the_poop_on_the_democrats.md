You know, if I was the head of the committee planning a major convention in a big city, this would be [job one](http://news.bostonherald.com/dnc2004/view.bg?articleid=35696) in my mind.  
   
News flash to all you committee heads out there: Kansas City is the most toilet-friendly city in the universe. Keep our fair town on your short list! Not only can you go into any establishment and use the facilities without making a purchase, the bathrooms are almost invariably on the main level. No long flights of stairs to climb like in New York and Boston, only to then find yourself face-to-face with a very locked door.  
   
And for those among us who still think the Dems poop don't stink, we're about to find out the truth.
