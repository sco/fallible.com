      i've been checking too, multiple times a day. perhaps this is a commentary on college students and how we have too much time on our hands.

      Hmmm . . . is this new character smart, attractive, fit, and funny?  
        
      Oh, and I definitley don't have too much time on my hands, there's not enough hours in the day! (you know, for important stuff like watching movies and gabbing with the roomies).

      Bethany, We domestic engineer-writers fit your demographic, too, I'm afraid.  
        
      Lynnelle, My character Lynnelle is a caller to my main character's radio talk show. Lynnelle is a bride-to-be whose parents are feuding. It is a bit part, at this point, by who knows? (Certainly not I!)  
        
      Lindsey, I am so happy that you've seen fit to pull others of your acquaintance in for a read. You and Bethany are jewels.

      uh oh, I hope that isn't an omen.  
        
      In-laws.  
      ps. My name doesn't have an e on the end of it, but don't feel bad. I get called lionel and lie-nell pretty often.

    text: "Lynnell--I do feel bad! I've spelled your name correctly in this space, and now incorrectly. Both times, I looked back at your signature to make sure it was right!! I wrote Lynnelle's story into the novel yesterday, and I used an \"e.\" I may keep the e, because of the way it lends a decided frenchness to the name, but I am thinking only of you! (She isn't like you, and her life isn't yours, either. Total fiction. But the name is close...)"

"You're losing us, Mom."  
  
It's hard to hear these words from a daughter's lips. It makes a mother pause and reflect. What have I done to alienate her, to drive her from me? And who else am I losing?  
  
"I got my roommate started reading your blog, and she got addicted. Then you didn't blog for over a week. She's been checking twice a day, and nothing. What is Lynnell supposed to do now?"  
  
I have failed two young women, maybe more for all I know. I never meant for it to be this way.  
  
Lynnell, in case you've checked in one last time, I'd like to somehow make it up to you...but how?  
  
I've got to get back to work on my novel now, and a new character is just emerging from the shadows and making herself known. Guess what? Her name is Lynnell.
