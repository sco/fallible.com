I have inherited a lock of hair. A dark brown wisp, tinged with a faint auburn, taped with yellowed cellophane onto the faded page of a mildewed book. I gasp when I turn the page and see it, recognize it instantly, though I haven't seen him face to face for forty-seven years. I pulled his hair more than once, I bet, and he cried or laughed, or both. And maybe pulled my hair in return. And then he died. And now a single tear has fallen on my brother Patrick's lock of hair.
