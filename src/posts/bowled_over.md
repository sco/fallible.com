I'm still enjoying your site!<br><br>Maria--It has NOTHING to do with culture! Tee, hee. It's just a large salad-sized bowl carved from a single piece of wood. In the Ozarks, roadside shops hawking walnut bowls appear approximately every 10 miles. But it's fun every time!"

    text: "Bethany, Funny you mentioned this. I have one of that kind of walnut bowl, too! Carved out of the nut, with the top half cut away until there's only a handle remaining. Like a little basket. I bought it in an Amish shop for my dollies to play with. So."

![walnut bowl](http://www.fallible.com/bowl.jpg)I own a walnut bowl that's seen better lives. It's been waterlogged so many times its finish is marred beyond repair. I should have pitched it decades ago, but it's not going anywhere as long as I have breath.  
  
It's not a walnut bowl at all. It's my grandmother's voice. She died when I was eighteen, and the bowl passed to me, along with the remembrance of those long and winding drives through the Ozark hills of Missouri and Arkansas when I was a child.  
  
"Pat!" she'd exclaim with delight to my grandfather. "Walnut bowls, just another 1/2 mile up the road. Slow down, fast, or you'll miss it!"  
  
To anyone else, it's a crummy old walnut bowl. To me, it's a voice in the wilderness crying, Slow down, fast, or you'll miss it.
