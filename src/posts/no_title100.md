    text: "Bet--Of the many lively discussions Scott, Rachel and I enjoyed on topics about culture, one that came up was kids your age going to dance clubs where some of the dancers are \"grinding.\" I am of the opinion that some \"dance moves\" are meant to be done in the privacy of one's home, with a marriage partner!! Call me old-fashioned. We talked of many other equally fascinating things. Tee, hee."

      No Mrs. Raymond; You really should ask him.

My son Scott invited me to go to Michigan with him to a writer's conference! We're leaving today for a five-day trip. Spending time alone with an adult child is just like when I spend time with my mother, only in reverse. For example, I must allow Scott to snicker when I obsess over silly travelling details, and realize that, of course, he's right--I need to chill. I would be snickering at my mom, too. And while I've taken to asking my mother if she needs to use the bathroom before we leave the house, I must resist asking Scott if he needs to go potty. Please, dear God, don't let him ask me!
