Solidifying and verifying an older person's lifetime memories is a process filled with laughter and tears, but essential if the future generations of the family hope to preserve precious history.  
  
My brother had my grandfather's home movies made into a DVD, and we viewed it with my mother today. The show started with my mother about age eight, and ended with my little sister Mary as a toddler. It included a lot of footage of my brother Patrick, who died when I was almost two. None of us had seen these movies, ever.  
  
John warned my mother about the scenes of Patrick, and told her to be honest if she didn't want to watch them. She did remarkably well reliving that part of her life, seeing him in his cowboy outfit, which weighed him down as he endeavored to climb into his Kidillac Pedal Car, and herself in short shorts and midriff top. She smiled with watery eyes at the scenes of him passed from adoring grandmother, to grandfather, to daddy and back into her arms again.  
  
His time was short, but sweet, both then and again today.  
  
Mom narrated throughout the silent movie, filling us in on her aunts and uncles and grandparents and childhood friends. She saw her buddy Mary Sue and said, "And to think she's still my friend."  
  
And then we came to a moving picture of a large woman, whose presence filled the screen, and my brother said, "Mom, who is that?"  
  
"She's our neighbor when we lived on 70th Terrace, around 1938," she said. "Her boobs were huge and stuck straight out."  
  
"Well," my brother said, philosophically, "I bet they don't now."  
  
You come together hoping to hold onto the distant past, and find pure gold in the present moment.
