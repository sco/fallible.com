I've always believed that God is love. But it used to be, when I wondered at the vastness of the ocean or the intricacies of a maple leaf, I couldn't imagine God even noticing me. Much less loving me. Last night, I stared up at the full moon with fresh awe. Its beams fell shining upon my face, but I didn't need them to. Just seeing the moon's beauty made me think of Him for the thousandth time in a day. And remember how completely I am loved.
