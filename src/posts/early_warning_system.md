I am completely deaf in one ear, unless I'm on the brink of a raging migraine. Then I hear *everything*. It isn't pretty.  
  
Right now, my deaf ear is pointed toward the kitchen, three large rooms away. I can hear Doug chewing toast. Every nuance of the toast-eating process, from the silver knife first slathering butter across the rough-textured bread, then scraping off the excess, to the way his teeth perform the intial vicious tear through the crusty edge, to the sound of the crunchy bread mixing with saliva to become a doughy glob, resonates with an exquisite terror.  
  
"Don't chew so loudly!"  
  
He isn't chewing loudly, of course. I'm *hearing* loudly, and we both know what that means.  
  
Oh-oh.
