![Her Starbucks](http://www.fallible.com/starbucks.jpg)![His Starbucks](http://www.fallible.com/starbucks.jpg)The man and woman laid their drinks side by side on the low counter, removed the lids, and considered the toppings.  
  
Skim milk, whole milk, half and half, sugar, spice, everything nice.  
  
*Especially her*, he seemed to be thinking.  
  
They made an attractive couple, cleary compatible if appearances count for much. If anything, she was a little out of his league--polished beside his passable, Pendleton next to his Penneys.  
  
"What did you get?" she asked  
  
"Caramel Macchiato," he answered.  
  
And then she bent from the waist until her nose was almost in his steaming brew and inhaled deeply.  
  
"Aahhh..." she sighed, and looked as if she might swoon and fall into his waiting arms, only they weren't waiting.  
  
The man blinked, astonished, but not too much so, considering it was possible she had snorted some of his caffeine, leaving less for him. He slid his cup six inches from her face with one hand and capped it off with the other.  
  
Smiles were exchanged between them then, and words, and they picked up their coffees-to-go and went, unbelievably, their separate ways.  
  
I wondered if he thought often of her after that, if he dreamed of what their lives might have been like if their one chance encounter had involved a little less of her nose and more of, say, her eyes.  
  
I didn't lose any sleep over it, but something made me wish he did.
