I had innocently gone to opthamologist for new glasses, and she said I had a swollen optic nerve and she scheduled an MRI of my head before I could insist I was perfectly fine. That was on a Friday, and the MRI was on a Monday. The MRI showed a brain in apparently fabulous working order! I do have to see a neurologist, though. Yawn. What's one more among so many? Thanks so much for your care!"

Wouldn't you think in this day of cell phones and email and instant messenger, you'd never feel the need to be chained to your house, waiting for an old-fashioned, the-doc-only-calls-if-it's-bad-news phone to ring? Waiting for iffy medical news feels just like waiting for a crummy boyfriend to call: You know the phone's going to ring eventually, but it'll be too late to go to the movie, and his car's broken down anyway. So why do I sit here? I'm waiting by my old home phone because there's certain stuff you only want to learn about while sitting in your recliner sipping a cup of coffee with whipping cream and sugar-free vanilla syrup. I'm waiting here because I've got a whirlpool tub I can retreat to at the drop of a phone. I'm waiting here because too many accidents are already attributed to drivers on cell phones. Why should I be one more statistic? As it is, I'm waiting and praying not to be one in 50,000, or one in a gazillion, or whatever. Wouldn't you rather do that at home?
