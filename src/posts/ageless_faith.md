      Sounds special! Wish I'd been there.

The man in the coffee house in Ottawa, Kansas, strummed the first few chords of the song and suddenly I was thirty years younger. And, as hard as it sounds to believe, all night I viewed the singer, his wife Anny, and Doug through a long-ago lense still miraculously unsmudged with age-defying wrinkle goop or hormone-replacement cream.  
  
The four of us, in fact, were the very picture of youth.  
  
He said if anyone in his audience of mostly teenagers knew the words, to sing along. Doug sat next to me and--never a great one for remembering even the words to songs he's written--tried to keep up. I sang my heart out, in almost perfect harmony.  
  
Even [Marc Haney](http://www.marchaney.com), our dear friend from the Jesus people days who taught us the song when he was nineteen (and he's about to roll over fifty), flubbed up on the lyrics a few times. He kept right on singing and strumming, though, mistakes and all--while trying not to laugh at himself when he saw us giggling.  
  
Maybe that's the most wonderful thing about old friends. Any pretense that might exist early in the relationship is eventually lost--if you endure long enough--to humbled ambitions, outgrown jeans, and graying hair. (And I'm only talking about myself!)  
  
And really, who had we come there to see? John the Baptist on the vast Kansas prairie? A reed blowing in the wind? A mighty prophet performing feats of music so amazing that the good coffee drinkers of Ottawa would throw large bills or better yet their debit cards into the jar on the edge of the stage?  
  
Or had we come to hear a humble Christian sing a simple gospel of faith in Jesus, just like we heard a lifetime ago when we all first believed? A man who may not have become famous, but one who has remained faithful?  
  
"Give your brother a helping hand and a prayer. Do your best to help him along. Learn to live together in peace and harmony, and then we'll all be singing the same song."  
  
Good Friday was good, indeed. We didn't go to church, or then again, maybe we did. It felt more like a piece of heaven to me.
