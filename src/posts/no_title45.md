      as always, i'll quote a little anne lamott: whenever she has work to do, she'll get up out of her chair and start examining her moles, wondering if they've changed color, or even location. then she'll call her brother steve, asking his opinion on the topic, and he always replies: "get to work, annie."<br><br>(keep working, katy.)<br><br>

OK, this is, like, the third day in a row that I've been free to write. And that I've actually written. And to that end, I've made distinguishable (if not distinguished) progress on my novel. This can't be happening. When you structure your life in such a way that you're the number one call when old folks push their "Help, I've fallen and I can't get up!" buttons, you stop expecting to get much else done. And when all your buddies know that you "work at home," they soon forget about the "work" part--and so do you. So, sure, I work at home, but I do lunch at the Cheesecake Factory, if there's any way in heaven I can. A girl's got to eat. But now I'm getting frantic. Three days running--what could it mean? Something's definitely not right. Any hour now, any second, horrible symptoms will set in, because that's what they do. I depend on vague but absolutely life-threatening illnesses to distract (if not outright kill) me on a daily basis. Otherwise, I will have to sit here and admit, against all logic, sound judgment, and previous experience, that my book might be coming together, after all. The prospect frightens me so much I pick up the phone to avoid it. There's a spinal tap I've been meaning to schedule.
