      Finally I understand what is meant by the phrase "holistic care".  
        
      Nice use of FB and Tweets, btw.

      Great idea, Katy. Maybe I could read the memoirs while Dave plays the Irish whistle?  
        
      Blessings!

      Oh, yeah...I know you're MY "person"! :)  
      Jim and I spent 5 hours in the ER yesterday. He called in the middle of my day, bawling, saying that he needed a ride to the hospital. His headache was a 10/10. I don't know if I've ever seen it that bad. After an IV, four drugs and lots of sleep, he is better today.  
      BTW..I'm on board to be your "person", too.

      Daniel--Holistic, yes. Also, my hubby and I have "become one." Your one-stop shop for end of life care! Yikes.  
        
      Hannah--We will provide you the whole range of cultural experiences!  
        
      Bridget---Ooooh, ick. Poor you and JIM. I have only made the migraine run to the ER once, but I remember the horror of it. I also remember the Demerol of it. I hope he is all the way better!!!!  
        
      Terri---This blog post really came out of my own fears. I know exactly what you're saying---I'm saying it, too. I plan to add another name to my Medical Power of Attorney list. Everyone should have two, anyway. Nuturing is nice (my man is oh, so caring...), but doesn't always fill the bill in certain situations.

Over lo these many years, which sometimes feel like many more than they actually are, I’ve developed something of a medical professional persona.

I say *persona*, of course, because it’s not possible for me to actually be a medical professional, if by that term one means someone who has received at least a modicum of formal education in the field. My formal education, which forces me to tick the box “some college” when filling out online forms to receive free samples from WalMart, consists primarily of credits in subjects that make my heart beat faster: American and British Literature, Speech, Composition, Western Civilization, Novel Writing, and Creative Writing. To my mind, I’d have a thoroughly well-rounded education if I wound things up with Art History, Photography, Interior Design, Graphic Design, Vocal Performance, and Theater.

I would probably *stil*l complete a degree if I weren’t so darned afraid of math and science---the two fields in which I find myself immersed in “real life” on a daily basis. HOW did I end up the bookkeeper for the business my husband and I own? I LOATHE tax forms almost as much as I resent our tax liability. I intensely dislike managing cash flow for a small business, since it requires a diligent setting-aside of money during the great months to compensate for the not-so-great and sometimes, well, I don’t feel like being diligent.

But here’s the thing: Even though math is not my favorite subject, I am competent to a fault. And therein lies my downfall.

The same is true with medical stuff----which in addition to math, involves plenty of the science I have always dreaded. Because of an unrelenting amount of personal experience----with my own body, the bodies of The Moms, and the bodies of various and sundry other friends and relatives----I now get asked CONTINUALLY by medical professionals whether I am an RN.

This question usually arises after a short conversation in which I am able to recall from memory my mother’s medical history dating back to 1964, including the dates of her gall bladder surgery, her parathyroid surgery, her liver biopsy, and the fall in which she shattered both her elbows.

I throw medical terminology around with the best of them, and in a way, I think it gives the real pros a bit of a thrill to know they’ve got a live one on the other end. But it’s not just words, either. I actually know how to suction a trach and administer a tube feeding. It’s amazing the stuff you learn when you must, in order to be the friend and caregiver God has called you to be.

But here’s the deal: Because I’ve saved a few lives here and there, folks are now coming out of the woodwork to say they “want me on their team” when their own bodies begin a sorry decline. Typically, these folks are married to very mellow spouses, who might not even recognize common signs of impending death like not breathing or having a pulse, but instead interpret these subtle signals on the part of the grievously ill to be simply indications that the poor, overwrought soul has finally “relaxed.”

Relaxed, my eye! Whenever anyone I know *relaxes*, I get them to the ER, fast! And so therefore, yes, my reputation is spreading as someone who just might be able to save *your* life in a pinch, too, and who *wouldn’t* want to stay in that person’s good graces? Mine’s a hard gig, but somebody’s gotta do it.

In the meantime, my dear husband is also getting requests from our aging acquaintances, since they’ve seen him, too, exude a quiet confidence in the face of life’s most stressful situations. He has a small notebook in which he notes their names when the solicitations come in, so determined is he to be of service whenever the need presents itself.

I worry about him, though. I know how exhausted I’ve become trying to care for the physical needs of those under my wing. I’d hate to see him meet the same fate. But what can I do? He seems resigned to his future as he adds each notation to his book, and assures all who request his services that he will remain stalwart in the face of challenges, and would not dream of failing them during the hour of their need.

So, here’s the arrangement: I’ll handle everything until they croak. Then he’ll play Irish whistle at their funerals.

Honestly, we’re both more than gratified to have made the cut.
