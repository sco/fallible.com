      Katy, I just want to tell you how much I enjoy this blog. I don't comment that often because I'm usually peeking at it on the sly at work, (I know, bad!) but I so enjoy your fun way of viewing life, and the big heart that you share with all of us. I tune in a couple of times a week with pleasure...and always enjoy catching up on the days I've missed. Blessings, Michelle

      Oh man! I just moved from a place where within blocks there are two malls with a Star of the Bucks, and a Pan of the Era. It also has a Barnes of the Noble, and a Borders of the Books and I miss it, miss it miss it here in suburban hell where you must have a car or catch the bus.  
        
      Sigh. I hope the writing went well, and I'm glad you had a good day. Me, too.

      Michelle--I've visited your site several times! You've got quite a lot of writing under your belt. Good for you! And your pic is SO cute.  
        
      Claudia--Your suburbs have buses? Kansas City is the worst when it comes to public transportation. Tim Samoff, who comments here, is a regular bus rider in KC, but you pretty much have to live in the heart of the city to catch a bus. Where I live? 30 minutes by car will get you...somewhere.  
        
      Bridgie--Does the 'burg have a Panera? You would enjoy it....  
        
      Cindy--We timed it right yesterday. Got there at the end of lunch hour, ate a bite, and then they turned the wifi back on. We worked a couple hours over coffee and drove home in a lovely spring snow shower! Gotta love Panera!

I'm watching the clock. It's already 9:30 a.m. I want to go get some writing done away from home, preferably in a free wi-fi environment, but the place I'm thinking of disables their wi-fi during the lunch hour, so I've got to get a move on.  
  
I start to pack up my laptop and say to Doug, "I think I'm gonna' go sit somewhere."  
  
"The Star of the Bucks?" he asks.  
  
"Nope. The Pan of the Era."  
  
We're having a good day.
