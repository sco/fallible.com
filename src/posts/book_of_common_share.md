      When I made my move to Missouri, I was forced to throw out (rather, donate to a used book store) more than 300 books... All loved children of mine that were waiting for a floor-to-ceiliong bookcase of their own... "One day," they mused. Alas, they finally got their bookcase. Just not in my home. I miss them.

      Tim, I, too, am in mourning over your lost books. Rarely have I gotten rid of a book I didn't miss later--unlike clothes or almost any other material thing. What's up with that?  
        
      Lisa, Doug says his books help "relax" him, which is hilarious. He's the most naturally relaxed man I've EVER known. His books keep me awake. Just knowing one of them is in the same bed with me makes me tense. ;)

All of Jim's books talk about how to kill people and mine show you how deal with those people who do. (My other books tell me how to write about it!) People would think we were both crazy!"

Since we purchased a Sleep Number bed by Select Comfort a few years back, we haven't had a headboard--just queen-sized mattresses on a frame. I miss my antique Ethan Allen cannonball bed, but not my crummy mattresses.  
  
When herniated disks and fibromyalgia set in, sacrifices must be made. Sigh.  
  
A couple of weeks ago, we made up for our lack of a headboard with matching floor-to-ceiling bookcases. His and hers, one on each side of the bed.  
  
There was a time when a peruser of our eclectic 1500 book collection might have imagined one or both of us to be multi-faceted, well-rounded readers. When we divided our books along party lines, the truth became evident.  
  
His:  
The Bible  
A Brief History of Time (From the Big Bang to Black Holes) by Stephen Hawking  
The Elegant Universe (Superstrings, Hidden Dimensions, and the Quest for the Ultimate Theory) by Brian Greene

The Quark and the Jaguar (Adventures in the Simple and the Complex) by Murray Gell-Mann  
The End of Physics (The Myth of a Unified Theory) by David Lindley  
The Last Three Minutes (Conjectures Avout the Ultimate Fate of the Universe) by Paul Davies  
Icons of Evolution (Science or Myth?) by Jonathan Wells

No separate beds for us, but separate bookshelves? A dream come true.
