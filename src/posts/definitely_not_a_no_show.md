      What a sweet story! And if I hadn't seen the American Idol impressions myself, I wouldn't believe that Carrie had it in her! :)

![Carrie](http://www.fallible.com/carrie.jpg)I don't call her my baby woman for nothing.  
  
I've called her that from the first time I laid eyes on her, twenty-one years ago last night. When your only baby girl makes her debut entrance at 10 lbs 5 oz, you've got a half-grown baby woman on your hands.  
  
It's been six weeks since Carrie's been home from college. Her father and I have been sadly lacking for entertainment.  
  
Oh, but she gave a grand performance this weekend, just like she's done since she was two, regaling her parents with all the spontaneous singing (gospel, contemporary worship, American Idol imitations), dancing (Irish and belly) and assorted other pent-up performances she's saved just for us.  
  
I was flat on my back with a migraine for one of her shows and, even with--or because of--all her audacious bawdiness, she cheered me.  
  
I hooted and hollered and laughed my head off at her antics, picturing her--as Steve Martin might his marriageable screen daughter--not quite as the grown woman she is, but more as a...baby woman.  
  
When I had finally exhausted my laughter, she took her bows and then said three true words.  
  
"You missed me."  
  
Oh, yes, baby woman. We missed you.
