      Katy, that was so pathetic, and so hilarious. Now I kinda want some Christian ankle beads!  
        
      I read Tony Jones' book The Sacred Way, and between that and the Divine Hours my bead jones came down--pun intended. I can assure you, the beads at www.fullcirclebeads.com are more lovely than they appear on the site. I was surprised that they are small. Nothing long enough to wear. It's such a blessing that God is renewing these sacred disciplines in our hearts. Let me know how you make out.

      Claudia--I went ahead and ordered my Anglican Rosary from fullcirclebeads, as well as the book explaining the prayers. I'm excited! I haven't read the books you refer to, but will check them out, as well. Thanks!  
        
      By the way, anyone who hasn't checked out Claudia's site, should. She is quite the ragamuffin diva!  
        
      Tim--I tried not to get too incensed, but sometimes it's hard, huh? To be fair, after I called Mardel's, I called Christian Book and Gift in Olathe. I phrased my question differently. "I've seen in your store that you carry Catholic rosaries." "Yes," she agreed. Then I asked, "Do you carry Anglican rosaries as well?" "No, we don't," she said. But at least I got the idea she'd heard the word "Anglican" before!

      Oh dear. I wish I could say I was surprised, but attending an evangelical non-denominational Christian high school robbed me of those happy delusions. You should've seen the looks I got when people found out I was baptized as \*gasp\* AN INFANT.  
        
      Have you read Girl Meets God by Lauren Winner? If not, you definitely should. It strikes me as a book you'd like a lot.

      Hello! I am new to your site and am really enjoying it.  
        
      Yes, I know what angelican prayer beads are but I sure wish someone would tell me what these ankle beads are that she st desperately wanted to sell you. They sure must be special.  
        
      I too "use to be" catholic. And the rosary is one of the things I also miss. I actually have one in my room siting beside a prayer candle I can't tell you the last time I used it or if I even remember how. I just like having it out.

      Oh, little Bethany...the injustices the infant-baptized suffer at the hands of those pesky non-denoms!! (I know--I'm infant baptized myself...) Doug and I just recently began attending the first denomination church we've ever gone to since we married. It's an Evangelical Free Church, but so far I can't remember if that means it's free of evangelicals, or they're free to be evangelicals, or they don't push you to tithe. Whatever, we like it a lot.  
        
      And yes, I like Lauren Winner a lot and have enjoyed Girl Meets God!  
        
      Jeanine--Welcome! I hope you have fun hanging here. I honesly think the clerk in the store hadn't heard the word "Anglican" before! Because no matter how many times I said it, she kept reverting back to "ankle," and wouldn't take Episcopal for an answer, either!  
        
      My Anglican rosary, which I will resist wearing on my ankle, should arrive tomorrow. I'm excited!

      You can use rosary beads to pray whatever you want on them, you don't have to do a Marian Rosary. You could do the Orthodox Jesus prayer: Lord Jesus Christ Son of God, have mercy on me, a sinner.  
        
      But what I like about the beads and the rosary in general is that they keep all of you occupied to help you get control over your mind and take your thoughts and imagination captive to Christ.  
        
      Physically, you're occupied touching the beads, mentally you're involved in saying the Lord's Prayer or the Glory Be or the Hail Mary and imaginatively you are meditating on a Holy Mystery. What room is there then for attack?  
        
      I'm Anglican Catholic and don't make a regular practice of doing the Rosary, but if something happens that knocks the spiritual wind out of me and has me obsessed or full of doubt or whatever, it's a wonderful way to pray.

      Deborah--Now, see, here's something else to look into: Anglican Catholic. I did not know there was such a group. Where have I been?  
        
      I've only just learned in the last week that some folks use the traditional Catholic rosary with different prayers than the ones I grew up with.  
        
      I know this sounds silly, but the sheer length of the Catholic rosary intimidates me right now. One thing I could really see doing with it, though, is reading through a long passage of Scripture, fingering one bead per verse. As a way to concentrate all of my focus, as you've said here.  
        
      I guess I was "obsessed and full of doubt" in the middle of the night last night, because I was up from 11 to 3:30. A girl can pray a lot of Anglican rosaries in that length of time!  
        
      Jan--Yes, I found that site after ordering from FullCircleBeads. They look beautiful! I received mine yesterday and love them. I also found that John Michael Talbot's site sells both Catholic and Anglican rosaries, made by the monks there. Thanks!

Have you heard about the [Anglican Rosary](http://www.fullcirclebeads.com/)?  
  
Honestly, until I caught up with some of [Ragamuffin Diva's](http://ragamuffindiva.blogspot.com/2005/02/bead-and-prayer.html) recent posts, I sure hadn't. Evidently, an Anglican priest came up with the concept in the 1980s. Ragamuffin's hubby purchased one for her online, where you can also get the book explaining how to use the beads.  
  
I haven't been a practicing Catholic since the age of seventeen, but I've been a practicing Christian my whole adult life. (Whoever said practice makes perfect hasn't met me.) I've gotta say there are things about Catholicism I've never stopped missing, and the rosary is one of them.  
  
It's not that I'm all about praying to Mary--I'm not. But I never got tired of the mysteries and the sorrows and the glories, and I crave them still.  
  
So I called Mardel's, a mega-Christian-book-and-merchandise operation here in Kansas City, and asked for the gift department.  
  
"Do you carry Anglican prayer beads? Kind of like rosaries for Protestants?"  
  
"Ankle beads? I'm not sure we have any left..."  
  
"No, not ankle. Anglican. Beads, like a rosary..."  
  
"We don't have any ankle bracelets right now. We might get more, though. We've got some beaded necklaces..."  
  
"Not ankle bracelets and not beaded necklaces. Not jewelry of any description. A rosary for Anglicans, who are kind of like Episcopalians, some of whom use a string of beads with a cross attached to say their prayers. Like Catholics do, only Anglicans are Protestants, like you. So, what I'm asking is whether or not you carry Anglican prayer beads."  
  
"I'm sorry, ma'am. We're all out of ankle beads."  
  
Yeah. Sometimes I really miss being a Catholic.
