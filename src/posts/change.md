![](http://www.fallible.com/img/thumbnails/tree.gif)The year draws to a dreary end. It's late November by the day's look and feel. At any moment, the bitter rain will give way to an early snow, and the harvest moon to a cold winter's sun.  
  
We speed down the road, you and I, and lose sight of where we are and when we live. We move through time without a pendulum, barely catching the flickering whispers whirring by through the glass, darkly.  
  
It is Autumn, isn't it?  
  
Before our eyes, gowns of gossamer green are pulled over outstretched brown limbs, covering their spindly nakedness. The undressed seem more embarassed by it than they were even yesterday, and furtively scan the ground for spare fig leaves.  
  
A few old rusted leaves mourn in the afternoon gray, ashamed to have overstayed their visit until Spring, but too set in their ways to fall gracefully now.  
  
It is not Autumn, though our very bones are chilled. It is Spring.  
  
The past still hangs heavy in the air, and yet what's to come is already upon us.
