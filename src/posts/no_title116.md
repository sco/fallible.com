If there is such a place as purgatory, I think I know how it feels. You know that interminable length of time-or is it eternity?-that elapses after you undergo a crucial diagnostic medical test, and before you find out the results? You know how you go into the test feeling pretty well, thank you very much, pretty confident that the thing they're looking for won't be found? It's amazing how that confidence dwindles into a pathetic puddle of quivering insecurities until you finally see the Doctor's smiling-or somber-face. You might even have come down with a few dreadful or deadly symptoms during the wait for results that, if you're lucky, will all disappear with one word from his lips. Every day, I sense the Great Physician smiling upon me, and I can see in His eyes that I get to live eternally with Him, after all. He never put me through a battery of painful and fearsome tests. He only asked that I believe He's already passed every test on my behalf. Even so, purgatory sometimes seems real here on earth, and I think I know just how it would feel.
