      So very wrong.  
        
      But so very well written.

      heehee...how long has it been since you've had butterflies in your stomach?  
        
      P.S. Thank you for your beautiful comment, it's been really hard lately.

I'll beat him up for you!\" Which is hilarious all by itself, if you know Doug. I told Doug the guy had already set his sights on another chick, a Middle Eastern woman who spoke almost no English. I heard him badgering her, and kept my eye on them until she reconnected with the group of businessmen she was with. Sheesh."

    text: "Susan--Well, where have you been all my life? We could do some serious scoping! Truly, people watching is one of my favorite things, but I do manage to find a psycho-killer in every crowd. The difference this time is that this guy really IS one. I can just tell..."

So I'm sitting in the hotel lobby, waiting for Doug to get "home" from work. And there's this tall, dark, and handsome businessman (first and only impression here, since I'm really not looking...) who keeps moving from chair to couch to closer chair to propped against a pillar to closer couch, all in an apparent effort to disuade me from thinking he's scoping me out, which I'm certain he is.  
  
Now he's perched on a loveseat against the wall, directly opposite from where I sit, in my line of vision except for an enormous specimen of palm-tree-like synthetic foliage. Every few seconds, I take a quick glance without stopping the continuous loud clicking of my fingers on the keyboard, so utterly businesswomanlike am I. And at exactly each instant I look up, he has found a sliver of space between two fronds through which to peer at me with steady (or are they stealthy?) eyes.  
  
His phone must have rung because he's picked it up now and he stands so that I see his whole face, and I wonder why they don't make taller fake trees for situations like this.  
  
Just before he walks away, he speaks to his faraway wife on the other end of the line, but he looks directly at me.  
  
"Hi, honey."  
  
I don't even breathe.
