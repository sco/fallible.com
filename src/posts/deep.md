      When I have made the comment, "I was touched on so many levels" What I meant was that it was intellectually appealing, spiritually uplifting, well crafted, and aesthetically appealing.  
        
      I think other people see it as art that makes a political statement.

    text: "J Al--If I were to say \"I was touched on so many levels,\" I would mean what you mean. It's just that too often, I encounter art that doesn't seem to touch me on any level! Maybe that alone makes it a political statement--tee, hee. Thanks."

You know how people say they love a certain piece of art because it speaks to them "on so many levels"?  
  
Doug and I just got back from the Plaza Art Fair, where we actually began to question whether or not we have levels.
