By now I've decided that the recurrence of the word "integrity" everywhere I go this week is not just a coincidence. And that maybe--OK, more than maybe--Somebody's trying to tell me something.  
  
Pastor Tom Blasco at Great Plains Community Church spoke of it on Sunday, and I nodded and "amened" my way through the sermon with ease. He only addressed integrity as it affects my relationships with others: Do I tell the truth? Do I do what I say I will do? Do I agree with God when my actions and attitudes don't line up with His commandments? That kind of thing.  
  
Don't get me wrong: It was a great sermon. It's just that sometimes, when I say "great," I mean that this particular sermon didn't require a specific response from me. Great means "off the hook for another week."  
  
But as it turns out, God was using Pastor Tom just to lay the groundwork. Ouch.  
  
Twice today, once in a book I perused at Barnes and Noble, and the second time during a chance viewing of Oprah, the same message hit home.  
  
Integrity is broken with serious results when we break our promises to *ourselves*. When we commit to a course of action and then renege. When we raise our hand at church to indicate our intention to pray for a missionary, and then never think of him again. When we admit we're addicted to a time-waster or a health-ruiner, and promise to turn, but don't.  
  
I would never think of breaking a commitment to someone else, but I rarely succeed in accomplishing the important goals I set for myself. Each time I fail, I trust myself a little less. I am a little less whole, have a little less integrity.  
  
For now, I think I'll make fewer promises to myself, and concentrate harder on fulfilling them. Maybe there's still time to turn this thing around.
