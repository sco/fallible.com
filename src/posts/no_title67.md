I've taken some measure of comfort in the idea that my faith, approximately the size of a mustard seed after lo these thirty years of believing, is large enough to move mountains. Imagine what the mustard seed of faith might be able to bring forth if I went ahead and planted it. "The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed, which a man took and planted in his field. Though it is the smallest of all your seeds, yet when it grows, it is the largest of garden plants and becomes a tree, so that the birds of the air come and perch in its branches." Matt 13:31 Moving mountains sounds grand, doesn't it? But there's something about those birds finding shelter in the branches of that glorious tree... Lord, grant me the grace to plant my tiny seed of faith.
