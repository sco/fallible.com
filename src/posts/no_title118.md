Glad you had power, though! \"Tearing down\" all the powerless paraphernalia after the power comes back on is like taking down all the Christmas decorations! It took a half day! Love,"

    text: "Hey, Nancy--We lost power for 72 hours, and even the phones went for 24. Used the propane space heater and eventually charged the battery for the generator and fired it up! All those Y2K preps do come in handy. I'm, like, SO vindicated! Thanks."

Until the third day, when the sun finally shone, there was no beauty at all. [![](http://www.fallible.com/img/ice/P1010048s.jpg)](http://www.fallible.com/ice.html)There were only shades from bleakest gray to abject black. In the midst of the lightlessness, the repeated crack of gunfire, followed by another shuddering collapse upon the frozen ground. All evening, all night, and all through the second dark day and night, our eyes and ears turned to the sound, sometimes every fifteen seconds, sometimes as seldom as once per minute. [![](http://www.fallible.com/img/ice/P1010007house2s.jpg)](http://www.fallible.com/ice.html)With the sun's return on Friday, we finally saw with clarity what we might wish to have remained hidden. The sky, a brilliant blue background for the ice enshrouded willowy branches, like a center jewel of deepest sapphire surrounded by a thousand gleaming diamonds. [![](http://www.fallible.com/img/ice/P1010001grasss.jpg)](http://www.fallible.com/ice.html)But, then, the ground, which should have been merely white with ice and perhaps a trace of innocent snow, strewn far and wide with the blackened branches claimed in icy battle. And if by chance no branch rests upon a small piece of ground, each blade of grass there stands up to celebrate, each one encased in its own tube of shimmering glass. [![](http://www.fallible.com/img/ice/P1010033vaneporchs.jpg)](http://www.fallible.com/ice.html)Two birds just landed on a perch of jewels, but not for long. They flitted from the very edge of a hanging twig to a spot nearer the trunk. Then, perhaps sensing that even the center may not hold, they moved to the porch railing, which stands steady. The center will hold, I thought, and wanted to tell them. The center will hold. Until the third day, when the sun finally shone, there was no beauty at all.
