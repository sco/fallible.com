      Oh, Katy, I love this post.  
        
      If your book doesn't win that contest, those people are nuts.

      Amber, Boo-hoo! My book did not win, but I am not giving up. I'm gonna keep plugging away... What is happening with your book? I hope it's going well!  
        
      Mary, The worst thing about being silly is when you imagine you're the only one. As soon as your fears are shared, they dissipate somewhat, don't you think? That was the joy of connecting with this guy...he was as nutty as I am.  
        
      On another note, I thought my fears of buzzing insects had been lessening the past few years, that I was becoming braver with advancing age. Yesterday, I realized that I'm only terrorized half as much now because I'm deaf in one ear.....I should have known! :)

      Oh, Katy! I'm sorry to hear that--but I know you'll press on. Your work is fabulous and God has plans for you beyond what we can ever imagine. Please keep me posted!  
        
      My book is coming along...I'm beginning a strict discipline of writing and have plans for the end of August, but I don't want to say too much for fear of missing my goal.

The young man and his lady walked right past us and we never looked up.  
  
Doug and I sat like Forrest Gump and his flighty girlfriend on a park bench in Boston Commons, giving our feet and my psyche a short rest before heading down to the Esplanade on July 4th. This was an event I had sworn to him I would not--could not--do, since I have the same response worming my way through public masses of teeming holiday revelers as I do being sausaged into an MRI machine.  
  
But there I was, wordlessly engaged in a minor panic attack, doing Lamaze breathing (very much more useful for anxiety abatement than it ever was for childbirth), and preparing to become *way* too close to a half million roller-blading, bike-riding, frisbee-tossing, beer-slugging strangers.  
  
I took a cleansing breath, let it out, and waited. I needed another minute. These things take time.  
  
The couple strolled on, and even though their backs were to us, I heard them laughing from twenty feet away, sounding fearless and adventuresome. I envied their apparent freedom and nonchalance. For all I knew, they'd never been to Boston before, either, but they were the kind of people who are at home in the world, no matter where they find themselves.  
  
I looked up then, aware that the man had stopped dead in his tracks and that the laughter had abruptly ended.  
  
He turned slightly in my direction in his attempt to avoid what was about to occur, but it was no use. His whole body tensed as a frightful yellow Boston-variety flying insect-like creature landed on his right shoulder. In one gangly, unfluid motion, he jerked his head to view his attacker, jumped back in terror, and used his left arm to fling the abhorrent thing from him.  
  
When the monstrosity loosened its grip on the young man and flew toward me, he turned. Our eyes met first, and then our souls, and when the Truth introduced us, it was like we'd known each other our whole lives. We exchanged the goofy grins of kindred spirits before he turned back to his lady and his path.  
  
"Let's go," I said to Forrest. And the yellow leaf fluttered at our feet.
