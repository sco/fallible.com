      Hi Katy,  
        
      I am a native KC Missourian, now living in the Northern Californian Mountains. I've decided to start a blog myself and have been researching blogs when I came across yours.  
        
      I'd like to compliment it's beauty and ease for reading.  
        
      I plan to "Blogroll" your site when I gt mine up and running and I plan to come visit more often now that I have a friend in the neighborhood. (I'll let you know my URL when I gt one.)  
        
      Thanks again for the pleasurable enjoyment and Happy Anniversary!  
        
      Dina

Nine years ago today, I began my fallible exploits in earnest with my shortest blog post ever: “I find these truths to be self-evident...but, then again, I could be wrong.”

I started the whole thing on a dare, really. My oldest son Scott said he thought I might be able to make a go of blogging, and that maybe I’d even be able to “monetize some dynamic eyeballs.”

You probably know I’ve never monetized an eyeball or any other body part, but MAN have I had fun!

Thanks for sharing all, some, or even only a few moments of your life with me here at fallible! I hope we have many good years still ahead.
