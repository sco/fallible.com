      Makes me want to follow through with a frivolous plan I had to join the D.A.R. AND the Cherokee nation. My mom's side goes back to the Pilgrims, my dad's very slightly Cherokee, just enough to get me in, I think.

      If you're from America, you're an American. Not by race or ethnicity, but by virtue of grounding your life here. I am an American not because I'm native (I'm actually Croatian) but because this is my home.  
        
      I don't believe Mrs. Kerry made claims to be African in race or ethnicity, so why the nit pick? I'm usually a pretty happy lurker, but I have to say I don't think August has been your greatest month.

I read the other day that Jesse Jackson was the first person to use the term *African American*, back in the sixties.  
  
Who knows if it's true? One thing seems certain: Whoever *did* coin the term probably didn't have [Teresa Heinz Kerry](http://news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&cid=1803&u=/washpost/20040812/pl_washpost/a58006_2004aug11&printer=1) in mind.  
  
Check out the fourth paragraph of the article. I thought I paid attention to Teresa's speech at the dem convention, but I missed this.  
  
OK, so she's an African American. By the same *token*, so to speak, that makes me a Native American.  
  
So her husband secures the African American vote, if for no other good reason than he has an African American wife?  
  
I'm fine with that. I just figured out my kids are entitled to college free-of-charge.  
  
Ain't labels grand?
