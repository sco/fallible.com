      Of course he's only partly right, comedy has nothing to do with faith, comedy laughs at faith, snickers, pokes holes in the underwear of faith. Comedy tells faith to put a sock on it, and then laughs all the way to the hungry i. Comedy, playing the fools as usual, says faith is for fools. Comedy is the phesant feather stroked sadistically across the left eyeball of God.  
        
      The tragic klown is a comic figure.  
        
      Comedy, stealing a line, says the joke's on him, says that this joke is like throwing a rose petal into Grand Canyon and waiting for the echo.

My novel has its funny moments, which I hope are somehow inspiring. I read this today, and it struck me as right:  
  
"Comedy is an escape, not from the truth but from despair; a narrow escape into faith."  
\--English playwright Christopher Fry
