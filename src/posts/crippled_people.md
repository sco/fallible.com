      This reminds me of my mom! Exactly. She had balance problems from a deteriorating inner ear, but she refused to use a cane because she didn't want to look old. This meant she was almost completely house bound. She didn't go the the dentist very often, so her teeth rotted. Going to the hairdressers was too much trouble, so it got long and unkempt. But at least she didn't look old!

      Rebecca--Wow. Your poor mom. Ironic, isn't it? We don't want to appear to be "old" or "crippled," but by not facing the facts (and the big wide world) we end up convincing everyone that we're old and crippled....  
        
      I say grab a walker if you need one and let's roll!  
        
      Bridgie--Yeah, I know. If there was anything Mom liked to do for fun besides the Riverboat, I'd take her. Unfortunately, I'm the "sick" daughter--the one she calls when she's sick. Hey, I'm glad she's having fun with somebody!  
        
      Carrie--I sang that song to my mom a couple weeks ago and she laughed! You made that up when I was on crutches after my knee surgery in 1990, when you were eight!! I named this post "Crippled People" with your lyrics in mind! :)

      My family has been dealing with the effects of physical disability for several years. It has required us to change living arrangements, career, lifestyle. It has grown our faith and dependence on The Strong One.  
      A reflection: we all have physical disability--some are more hidden -- nearsightedness, weak heart, diminished hearing. The playing field of the world is more level than it appears.  
      A suggestion: Try sharing the disability, especially in public, to show your own sacrifice of pride. Push a walker or carry a cane. Ride a scooter in the store alongside your friend in the wheelchair. Ask for quick service in the restaurant, using yourself as the diabetic excuse when in fact it may be your dining partner. In small ways, we "walk" in the shoes of others, and we lay down any pretense that by hiding our disability, we are superior to others.  
      Thank you for your insightful posts!I'm new to your blog--Lee

      Lee--These are beautiful ideas. You captured so well the spirit of what I hoped to say! Thanks.  
        
      Julie--That's so funny! Yeah. My hubby and I argue about the cart, too. The person who's the most tired gets the "walker." Tee, hee.

"But I don't want to look like a cripple."  
  
This is the argument Mom and I get into most often, and I have no doubt but what it'll happen again today. It's Doctor Day, and I'm escorting her. I'll insist that Mom use the deluxe, Cadillac-quality rolling walker I bought her last summer when she blew her knee out, and that will make her mad.  
  
"We've been over this before, Mom," I'll say. "I can't catch you if you fall. You can't depend on me for that. You have to use your walker."  
  
Mom is unsteady on her feet. She's frequently dizzy and lightheaded, and often complains that she's about to keel over. And she's no small lady. In fact, Mom is exactly twice my size. Not only that, but I also am the bearer of a couple herniated discs in my neck, making me a poor candidate for Catcher of the Mom.  
  
I would say that the spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak--except for that some days, not even the spirit is willing.  
  
Mom used to say she wouldn't use a cane because she "didn't want to look old." Old, I'm sorry to say, has had its way with her, and she's gradually shifted her viewpoint. Now it's apparently OK if she looks old, as long as she doesn't look crippled.  
  
"I can't worry about how you look, Mom." I will say. I don't want to sound mean, but she's stubborn and I have to stick to my guns. "I'm responsible for keeping both of us on our feet. We're taking the walker."  
  
We all have ways we want to look, don't we? And ways we'd like to avoid appearing, also. Is anyone really fooled when we look whole, but then fall alone to the ground, a shattered mess?  
  
Each of us ends up depending upon an assistive device of one type or Another, whether we care to admit it or not. It takes grace to lean on something--Someone--we've hesitated to fully trust, even if that Someone happens to be the only one who can truly support us in our weakness.  
  
Mom will stand upright behind her walker today, pouting, and give it an unwilling first push forward.  
  
"But I don't want to look like a cripple..."  
  
Me, neither, Mom. But I'm learning to want it more.
