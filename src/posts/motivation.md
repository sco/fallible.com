      What a tremendous boost to the ego! I bet she was red in the face when she saw your ID :) That was way cool. May you have many more days like that! :)

Maybe Wal-Mart has a rule that they HAVE to card everyone? I can't imagine.<br><br>Ellen--I didn't try to buy alcohol on my 21st, but I would have felt gypped, too! Half (or more) the fun of it is to get carded. I probably didn't buy anthing until I was 30, now that I think of it, and I did get carded then, but I was still fairly young then. Go back when you're 30 and give it another go! I'm predicting there's a thrill out there just waiting for you!"

Felt like they were saying I was immature, which was probably immature :) At any rate, now I get teased because I go around telling everyone I'm 40. If I could, I'd hold up 40 fingers too! <br><br>I was carded the other night but I think the waiter thought he might get a better tip, so his motivations are tainted!"

    text: "That's funny. My wife works as a waitress at TGI friday's where it is company policy to card anyone requesting alcohol who looks under the age of 40. I think it's quite ridiculous, but if you get an image boost from it I guess it can't be all bad."

Ten days ago, at the age of forty-nine-and-one-half-years old, I got carded.  
  
(Okay, I may be deaf, but I can hear you laughing from here!)  
  
I can count the times I've purchased alcohol on one hand, but the low-carb kahlua cheesecake my brother-in-law wanted for his birthday left me with no choice but to purchase a big honking bottle of vodka. When duty calls, I answer.  
  
"Are you old enough to buy this?" the check-out lady at Wal-Mart asked. It was the first item I put on the counter, so I thought she might be speaking to the young woman in line in front of me.  
  
"*She's* probably too young," I laughed, "but I think I'm okay." I kept right on putting items on the counter, not aware the woman was still staring at me until she spoke again.  
  
"I'm going to have to see some ID," she said, unsmiling.  
  
She made me feel so young that since then I've cut way back on my excessive caffeine consumption, started drinking more water, stopped eating my beloved Triscuits (which are filled with trans-fatty acids), lost 3 pounds, joined Curves for Women, and bought an ankle bracelet.  
  
An apt word, spoken in season, brings life to the one who hears it.
