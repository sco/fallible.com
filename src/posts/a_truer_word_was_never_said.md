      I don't use this one, and I don't think it is technically a cliche, but I get willies when I hear it:  
        
      "Things can't get any worse."  
        
      Um, yes they can.

    text: "A few years ago, I became aware of a cliche from England, that isn't one here. It was used by Paul McCartney in an interview. He spoke of throwing \"the cat among the pigeons.\" It's so wonderfully evocative. When the cat is thrown among the pigeons, trouble obviously ensues. When one does it deliberately, one is equally obviously trying to pick a fight or at least, get people thinking. I love the phrase!"

      yesterday i said to my near nine year old (in response to his request to sit indoors and play endless video games) "go outside! you'll wish for one of these days in August!" to which he replied - "you ALWAYS say that." one of my own personal cliches, perhaps...

As a writer, I make every attempt to keep my prose as cliche-free as possible, but in my "real life," it's not easy.  
  
The one that's got me going recently, for reasons I won't go into, is "A watched phone never rings."  
  
If a truer cliche was ever said, I'd like to hear it. What's the one cliche *you* can't stop using, no matter how you try, because it's just so darned TRUE?  
  
Or do you know of one that doesn't even deserve the moniker "cliche," because it doesn't hold any water at all? (How about, "A watched pot never boils." Um, yeah. It *does*.)  
  
I'd like to know.
