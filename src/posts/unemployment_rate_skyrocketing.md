      Katy - I'm that faithful 1 that visits you nearly daily. I have your blog in my bloglines.com notifier, so it tells me when I should come visit your blog for the latest dish.

      I do the bloglines thingy too.  
      I would guess your hit count corresponds to your post count. You were absent for a while Babe.  
        
      Take Care

      Yeah, life has gotten complicated over here...  
        
      Yesterday, I almost posted my intention to take a vacation from blogging, which I've never done before. But I've been exhausted and overwhelmed and borderline-ill over the situation with my mom, and sometimes I don't know if it's worth it to try to write through it.  
        
      BTW, Doug noted after I posted this that my weekday hits hadn't decreased--it's just that my weekend hits have increased! So maybe I won't take that vacation, after all. :)

      Hey, Susan! Be afraid, be very afraid...it's SO EASY to get addicted to reading blogs! And then, of course, you'll have to start one yourself.....it's big fun!  
        
      Several posts down this page, I refer to the article in the magazine. I need to email the author to find out how she found fallible--I remain mystified by the whole thing!  
        
      Thanks for stopping by. Happy Blogging!

You may not believe this, but I pay almost no attention whatsoever to my blog stats. I'm just not a numbers kind of chick, I guess. I'm into words--both the ones I share with you, and the ones you share with me. As long as that's happening, I'm happy.  
  
Doug likes following stats, though, and every so often he gives me the scoop about what's going on out there in Statsville.  
  
"You know what's weird?" he asked tonight. "For the past two weekends, your stats have been way up from what they were on the previous Monday through Thursday."  
  
I've always known that blog readers tend to drop off on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday, presumably because they've, well, got better things to do. I've always assumed a lot of folks catch up on their reading on their employer's dime.  
  
So here's my question: Did everyone suddenly quit their day jobs, or what?
