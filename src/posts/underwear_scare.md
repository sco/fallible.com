It's official: I've sustained my first sports injury.  
  
My exercise program is well into its second week, incident free. Until now.  
  
I am careful not to compromise my already-funky knees with any jarring movements, and cautious when introducing weights because of the herniated disc in my neck. So far, my strategy had been successful.  
  
This morning, I barely survived strangulation, though, while attempting to wrangle my way into a sports bra.  
  
Life is frought with peril.
