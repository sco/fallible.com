    text: "Lisa, I know it like it was yesterday. I honestly didn't think \"outside\" work was a great idea until Kev (the baby) got his driver's license. I was a private chauffeur until then. As for a managed nutritional plan, well, I was 46 before that idea clicked! Poet's nightgowns can ease a woman through a lot of transition. I slept in one, thought about it, and highly recommend it for any stage of life."

      Hey, don't knock the Wally World gig! It was a great job...a lot less stressful than teaching! :)

The fear of the unknown is a terrible thing. It often drives me to commit to some ridiculous course of action, such as accepting a real job, which guarantees my future unhappiness even as it provides some modicum of "security." When I'm fearing the unknown, I tend to equate "security" with "purpose." It always proves to be a dreadful mistake, and I feel myself edging closer to committing it again by the minute. Invariably, when I'm on the vocational brink of finally doing that which I am made to do, my husband and I enter into a financial quagmire, the depths of which are likely to be plumbed in full measure unless I go land a depressing job with extraordinary benefits. The temptation to "go therefore and do likewise" is upon me again, more convincingly this time than it has been at any time in the past twenty years. I am helpless to resist. But, wait. I am a better woman than I was the last time I gave in to this deception. I am stronger, more resolute and (dare I say it?) more sanctified. I understand now that there is no temptation so great that God will not also, with it, provide the way of escape. And so I will endure, steadfast, until the way of escape is made known. Suddenly, filling out an app at the new Walmart down the road just lost its luster.
