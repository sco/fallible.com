      We caught sight of this about a month ago and fell in love with it. Our kids loved it too!

      Been laughing for some months. Too clever! Perfect balance, too -- making fun of himself and certain Christian stereotypes without mocking truth or God.  
        
      I tend to think laughing at ourselves may be the first step toward getting some folks to take us seriously. At any rate, it's a fun ride.

      Hey Katy  
        
      Are you on vacation?  
      I'm paying good money to read your stuff... Wait a minute. Subscription to your site is free.  
        
      ...Sorry, never mind. Carry on, I'll wait.  
        
      Take Care  
      Michael

      My idea of a vacation right now is to watch "I love big Bibles and I cannot lie" over and over until I can't stop smiling.  
        
      Michael--Actually, I've had a couple of deadlines pressing. So I've taken care of two big ones this week. Now I've started writing an assigned article for Today's Christian magazine, but I've got a little time to get it done.  
        
      So you think I should blog, huh?  
      Real Live Preacher is taking the entire month of April off, so he can do his other life...Sometimes, it's tempting. Especially during those weird synactic lapses in which I have NOTHING TO SAY!  
        
      I'll try to get it together soon...

      When is your first article (or when was it?)  
        
      Is the magazine available on-line?  
        
      I'd love to read anything by you.  
        
      Take care

      PS - RLP won't last that long

If you've already seen [this](http://www.milkandcookies.com/links/25512/), you have the advantage of having been laughing longer than the rest of us.  
  
If you're just now seeing it, I hope you get as big a kick out of it as I do.  
  
I'm ditching my wimpy Bible on CD after that, baby!
