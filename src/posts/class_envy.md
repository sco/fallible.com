      "And looking around here at this group, I suspect there are only three people..."  
        
      I just saw the replay, and those are the Senator's exact words.

I watched the debate last night, and i just chuckled when Kerry made that comment, but I didn't think about what he was inferring, which was probably unintentional. I probably didnt think much of it because I'm not one of those fortunate people who make more than 200K. It annoys me how Kerry pretends, according to Hillary Clition, to understand \"the plight of the working class.\" He doesn't have any idea what the middle class goes through..."

      I'll go even further...I'll be there were a dozen or more people who would be taxed under Kerry's plan...  
        
      Know any small business owners who "make" 200 thousand dollars a year? Lots of them do. They may dole out cash for overhead, new vehicles, employees, but their "income" ...what Mr.Kerry is talking about taxing is not their after taxes, after deductions, after expenses, after reinvestment income...it's their GROSS income...  
        
      The couple who run the dry cleaners, the convenience store owners, the couple who own ONE McDonald's restaurant... They're the RICH folks Mr. Kerry wants to tax more...and guess what happens when he does that ... The "average" people Mr Kerry sees from his lofty perch stand a good chance of becoming the "unemployed" people he's fighting for since Mr Bush has created so many more of them...5.7 percent of the labor force... the same number as when Bill Clinton was in office and was touting how low unemployment was.  
        
      The top 1 percent of taxpayers got the biggest tax cut under Mr Bush....  
        
      Duh.  
        
      If you pay the most taxes, when they cut taxes, you get the most back. This is called ...um....math.  
        
      Dang...um.. panties, girdles, socks, and dogs.. sorry...I started getting political again.

      Jeff, Glad you stopped by! Hope you visit again. I admire anyone who can stay relaxed during election season. Most of us weren't blogging four years ago, so a bunch of partisan crazies have been unleased on the unsuspecting blog-reading public! I'm trying to calm down... :)  
        
      Michael, Why don't you tell us how you really feel??? One thing my hubby brought up that isn't talked about a lot: some of these "rich" people (the ones Kerry hopes we love to hate) live in parts of the country with costs of living so high that a $200,000 income might not be enough to afford a decent house. Those folks are going to be taxed into the poor house. I predict if Kerry wins and his soak the rich plan goes into effect, there will be a tremendous migration of folks into the middle states, where they can still afford to live reasonably well.  
        
      BTW, I thoroughly enjoy and learn from your passionate comments. Thanks!

      The goes without saying. But are you not the least bit offended that he promised that the "vast majority of \[his\] tax cuts will go to the bottom half"?

      Before w get our knickers in a twist over "outsourcing"...has anyone offered up any real numbers?  
        
      They aren't easy to find...however Forrester research, which is neither a tool of the GOP or the DEMs estimates:" fewer than 300,000 jobs a year will be displaced through services outsourcing over the next decade... 300 thousand over 10 years."  
        
      In the last quarter, 1.7 million jobs were created in the U.S.....1.7 million created in three months...300 thousand low paying jobs sent overseas in 10 years.  
        
      Over that 10 year period the same research shows the country (no matter who is in the white house) will lose 15 million "gross jobs" ... this is not counting job gains..simply jobs that will disappear due to technology, obsolescence, etc...  
        
      So the evil of outsourcing will account for less than 2 percent of the gross job losses over 10 years.  
        
      This is the issue you are basing your vote upon?  
        
      Make no mistake, the Republicans and the Democrats will try to "scare" you.  
        
      "Terror lurks around every corner, Social security is going to dry up, our senior citizens will be eating little friskies!!!"  
        
      Nose around...look for facts. They're hard to find, because the facts don't back up the fears.  
        
      Look behind the curtain...you'll see that much of what has been dropped on our doorsteps was left their by the hind end of Toto, Dorothy.  
        
      I work in the media... there are strict guidelines advertisers have to adhere to in terms of truth...it's the law. Make claims that are false you can face federal charges and civil penalties...  
        
      That's for all advertisers..  
        
      oops...sorry...one exception was written into the law.  
        
      It doesn't apply to political ads.  
        
      hmmmm....could it be someone is <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/bp">untrustworthy?</a>

      Wow. Excellent post, Michael.  
        
      One thing I have learned in my quest for a business degree is that outsourcing isn't a bad thing. Yes, it hurts initially, yes jobs may be lost inititally. But higher end jobs will replace the low end jobs that get outsourced. Say you work in a factory, second shift your entire life, and the factory is outsourced to Brazil. You lose your job. But eventually, you get retrained (as technology increases), you become a better and more hireable worker, and you end up working in an office for slightly better pay. Good thing? You betcha.

      Dear Alison,  
        
      You said, "Neither candidate is perfect, but for you to write paragraph after paragraph full of gripes about only Kerry shows that you're looking at this election with red-tinted lenses. Objectivity is not welcome here."  
        
      This is a personal blog. Where someone writes their personal opinions and observations. Here, Katy wrote a single post centered on one subject. Had she journeyed further to discuss \*every single issue\* that surrounds this Presidential Election, then I'm sure she wouldn't agree with every single thing that Bush has ever said or done during his time in office. As it is, that was not her purpose in writing this post (from what I can gather), nor did it call for you to insinuate that she was not an "honest person" nor objective. I'm almost positive that Katy welcomes discussion but she does not deserve attacks. If you have a blog of your own, I would venture to say that that space would be the correct forum for your "objective" thoughts.  
        
      Respectfully,  
      Amber  
        
      PS- thanks for the post, Katy.

      Allison,  
      Just a note...Katy is an incredibly honest person. (I should know; she's my sister.) Plus, she knows that I'm a big Kerry supporter, and has encouraged me to post my opinions on her blog about Kerry and about Bush. If you read past entries (and comments), you will see that I have done my share of commenting against Bush. Katy certainly allows posts that go against her opinions, but please don't call her dishonest or say that she's not objective. That's simply not the case. Thanks for listening...

      I would have posted here before now (Wednesday night, after the last debate...) but I live out in the boonies and our satellite has been down all day long!!  
        
      After reading through the comments a few times, I think Alison might have been questioning Michael's honesty rather than mine.  
        
      I really appreciate Amber and Bridget vouching for my efforts to encourage fair-handed discussion, and in turn I will vouch for what I know of Michael's character. Of course, I only know him through his blog and mine, and have not met him personally. But I have found him to be open-minded, intelligent, thoughtful, considerate of the beliefs and opinions of others, and honest.  
        
      Alison, of course you're welcome here! When the election is behind us, the blogging world will calm back down for a few years. Maybe. ;) I hope you'll continue to visit.  
        
      In general, I do kind of think of blogging like inviting people into my home. I'll clean and cook and try to show everybody some good midwestern hospitality, all free of charge. You decide whether you want to show up or not. And like a family, I don't expect all the siblings to agree all the time when they're at my joint! But at the end of the visit, I like to picture us patting each other on the back and saying what a great time we had, and let's do it again soon...

      Sorry, a little browser mistake there. If I may, I think everyone is referring to inaccurate statistics. By no means is outsourcing the main reason why so many Ohians are out of work, but it is a significant factor. And for the families who have seen their good paying manufacturing jobs go elsewhere, it's an issue of survival. Ali's father lost his job last year, and a lot of other people over here are facing the same situation. There's an abundance of food-service positions... these are where the jobs are now, but not the manufacturing jobs you can raise a family on. This is a big issue for us out here, and we tend to vote for those who have historically promoted the development of good paying jobs. It's upsetting, especially for those who have lost work and have struggled to raise a family. I noticed Alison didn't mention she had to suspend college.That's something that people with secure incomes should try to understand.

      Hi, Drina! My (very limited) understanding is that Ohio's problems are much worsened by the fact that the state tax there has been jacked up by your (Republican, I might add) governor. I've heard that many small business owners have had to leave Ohio because of the prohibitive taxes, and set up shop elsewhere, leaving even more Ohio workers unemployed.  
        
      If the taxes are raised on these folks yet again when Kerry socks it to the so-called rich, how will that help the current troubles in Ohio?  
        
      I sympathize with Ali's plight. I remember our family going through several bouts of unemployment when I was young, and it's horribly frustrating.  
        
      Ali, your passion for the issues is much needed in our society. Keep sharing your experiences and beliefs with others--it does make a difference.

I'm sure Senator Kerry figured he had the St. Louis audience where he wanted them when he talked about how they would all continue to get tax cuts, but that the top 1% of wage earners (those making more than $200,000) would have the proverbial screws put to them.  
  
Still, I think he crossed a line when he said that from the looks of those assembled, only three people in the room would have to fork it over--Charlie Gibson (the moderator) and the two candidates.  
  
From the looks of them? Where does he come up with this stuff? It's a well-established fact that some of the most successful business people in the country don't dress the part. Think of Sam Walton driving from store to store in his beat-up pick-up truck. Warren Buffet isn't too impressive to look at, either. And the young wealthy tech entreprenuers appear every bit as middle-class as their employees.  
  
Senator Kerry taking one cursury look at the St. Louis crowd and deciding there wasn't a success story among them is insulting. Hey, I don't look at someone's designer suit and BMW and automatically assume the guy's in debt up to his eyeballs, though, of course, he probably is.  
  
I'm growing weary of the whole class envy thing. Pitting the 99% (like those poor schmucks in St. Louis) against the one. I personally know a fair number of small business owners who fall into the 1%. To look at them you'd never guess it, and it's probably a good thing they never ramped up their lifestyles to match their earnings.  
  
If Kerry is elected, their ability to provide good jobs in the community (to members of the 99%) will be seriously compromised. Kerry's plans to provide health care to those who are sick of their high premiums and $4000/year college assistance to the deserving will be paid for by the 1%, who will have no choice but to cut employees to cover their hiked-up taxes.  
  
I'll bet you anything there was a member of the 1% in that St. Louis audience, a person who has chosen to blend in with his neighbors and friends and just be a regular guy. Too bad Kerry doesn't understand that looks are deceiving.  
  
Somebody, please give him a copy of The Millionaire Next Door!
