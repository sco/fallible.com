      So it goes. I guess you should count yourself lucky that at least the article was read before it got, uh, repurposed.

      Tim, Yeah. I'm all about recycling, but still....tee, hee.  
        
      Nikkiana, I'm happy I "get" blogging, because there's a whole lot of stuff I don't get. Like comparing cell phone plans. Like tracking a delivery that's only coming from a warehouse an hour away by talking to a call center in Indonesia, with a rep who doesn't speak English. Oh, dear, I feel another rant coming on.....  
        
      Keith, Thanks! The great thing about blogging, compared to publishing in the print world, is that blogs can't end up as birdie toilet paper, but I'm not bitter!

My mother is basking in my fleeting notoriety, as mothers are wont to do. I just got off the phone with her, and she couldn't wait to bring up the article in the Kansas City Star.  
  
"Well, *hello*," she said. "You...you...*typist*, you."  
  
"Typist?" I was confused, and thought she meant to say *writer*. Then it hit me. "Oh, you mean *blogger*."  
  
"I do? Oh, yes, I do. *Blogger*. Well, I took the newspaper article down to the nurses station to show two gals. I pointed out your picture and the parts about you. I left it with them so they could read the whole thing."  
  
She sounded so darned proud, I felt myself start to blush.  
  
"And then you went back and got it later?" I asked.  
  
"I went back later, and the nurses weren't there. I looked around and didn't see the paper..."  
  
"So you didn't get it back?"  
  
"...and then the parakeet started chirping and I looked over at its cage, and there was your picture in the bottom of it."  
  
Sigh. Some people just don't get blogging.
