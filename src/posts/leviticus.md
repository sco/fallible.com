      The clever, five blocks down the road answer would be 'You mean, on purpose?'  
        
      Can't you eat bees and still be a Christian? There was a fad going around a few years ago where you ate bee pollen. Was that it? It doesn't sound right but that's the way I remember it. It was supposed to cure all your ills and some people got downright evangelistic about it.  
        
      Somebody is always adding something to the gospel: Amway, bee pollen, snake handling, positive confession. The simple fact that the Son of God died for my sins is not enough.

      Will--It took me a minute, and then I laughed for an hour!  
        
      Angus--Yeah. Doug thought the guy must be talking about bee pollen. Maybe the company that advertises in all the Christian magazines. But, no. It was bees. The bumbley the better, I'm thinking. Doug didn't stick around for him to elaborate on his reasons....

"J'ever eadaby?"  
  
Thus opened the conversation between the gas station cashier and my husband.  
  
"Ummm...*j'ever*?" Doug handed him a debit card, mesmerized.  
  
"Yeah...y'know...the diet where yeadaby." The clerk seemed pleased to pass on his unconventional but trendy nutritional advice.  
  
"Uhhh...*yeada*?" Let's just say Doug's never been into fad diets.  
  
"Yeah. *Bee*." By this point, the clerk spoke with the clear voice of authority.  
  
"Oh...you mean, *did you ever eat a bee*..."  
  
"Well, yeah, *I did*. What I wanna know is, *jew*?"  
  
One thing about Doug: He knows a ministry opportunity when he sees one.  
  
"No. Christian. How about you?"  
  
"Ummm...I eat bees."  
  
Alrighty, then.
