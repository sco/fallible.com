      It's a sickness, I tell you, a sickness! And somone -- anyone -- needs to come up with a cure... And the first inoculation site? Jacob's Well. .That's right... And it needs to be quick. Very quick!  
        
      (Oh, and, I'll probably stop by the event myself -- but not until later, ok?!)

      Later?? And miss out on the t-shirt giveaway to the first 1000 through the doors? And even Scott was unaware--until his Dad told him--that they are giving away a G5, too.  
        
      Our first computer was a Mac (sigh...) and then, for some reason known only to God and Bill Gates, we defected. But we have been pining for the good old days...They say you can never go home, but baby, we're going....

    text: "Mary--The store was wrapped in brown paper? Or the stuff in the store? Because Brooke Raymond told me (when I asked if she thought they'd have plenty of I-books to go around) that yes, she thought they had a few. She'd been to the Plaza to peek in the windows!! Too, too funny..."

      Bobbi--Tee, hee! Well, my hubby and two kids got there at 9 am, and the line waiting for the 10 am opening was down the block and around the corner! And who were some of the first in line? The gang from Jacob's Well, including Pastor Tim Keel and his little girl, who brought a lovely book to read while she waited.  
        
      We all got our free Country Club Plaza Apple t-shirts, which I understand hit ebay within an hour of the opening for as much as $45. Where was I when God passed out the money-making-scheme gene?  
        
      Anyway, it was a blast, and now I'm blogging on my new iBook G4. I am a happy girl!  
        
      BTW, Bobbi, I am very much enjoying your blog!

The photo I wish I'd gotten, however, was from a drive-by yesterday morning before they were open; one of the cleaning guys, rag and cleaning solution stuffed into his back pocket, was playing with a powerbook right by the front window."

"If I was a single man," begins my son, Scott, who's been a married man for all of a month, "I'd camp overnight on the sidewalk outside the door."  
  
"What time will you and Brooke get there?" I ask. The doors open early, and there's a chance not everyone will get in. Doug and I plan to be among the first.  
  
"Eight," he says. "Some of us are meeting across the street at Starbucks. When we see the crowds start to gather, we'll make our way over."  
  
"So," I say, "Is this an official [Emergent](http://www.emergentvillage.org/) event, then?"  
  
Scott and Brooke attend a cool church, and I know how much the concept of community is valued by them and their friends.  
  
"Not quite official. But you're right. A lot of people from [Jacob's Well](http://jacobswellchurch.org/) will be there," he says. We exchange a knowing smile.  
  
The new Apple Computer Store opens on the Plaza tomorrow!
