My sister Liz organized a surprise 50th birthday bash for Doug Saturday night. (Happy Birthday, babe!) My mom sat across and down the long table from me. I caught bits and pieces of the conversation. Apparently, Liz had mentioned Mom and Dad's happy marriage, which lasted 33 years, till death did they part. "We had some good years," Mom said. "How many?" Liz asked. "Oh, ten," Mom answered. "Which ones?" "Well," Mom said, exasperrated. "They were SCATTERED!" If you could buy that kind of honesty from Wall Street cheerleaders, we wouldn't be broke today.
