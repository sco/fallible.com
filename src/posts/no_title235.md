      I had to go back and see from what humble beginnings sprang forth such a persistent and lovable work. I find it poinant that no one ever commented on your first posting. I hope this is a welcome enhancement and not an intrusion on the solitude of the opening stanza of your opus.  
        
      It would appear that this quotation in English may be the translation of the beautiful French wording in your heading. And it would appear that my theory this sentence translated roughly as "The evidence is clear. O.J. did it." was an unfortunate guess. Two years of junior high French down the tubes. C'est la vie.

I find these truths to be self-evident...but, then again, I could be wrong.
