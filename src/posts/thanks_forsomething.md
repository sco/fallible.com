      I'm thankful that I'm going to finish my book, and that it's then going to be published. And I'm thankful for the opportunities I'm going to have to play a part in ministering to the broken and wounded in the church.  
        
      I'm thankful that I'm going to finish school in the next two years; that I'm going to do what I love; and that God is holding me as I continue to work out my salvation with fear and trembling.

      I either thankful for my beautiful kids or my free-and-easy life without them -- as I do not yet know which is in my future... But I am thankful for both!  
        
      I am thankful for a playful dog who I can take on walks and watch running around in my backyard.  
        
      I'm thankful for the day when the doctors know why I had a heart attack.  
        
      Of course all of these things arent quite set in stone... But I'm looking forward for them to be.

      I'm thankful for my beautiful wife, our future together, and the beautiful, simple, and relatively cheap ceremony =)  
        
      I am also thankful to be graduating from college a semester early on December 10, 2005.  
        
      I am thankful the Lord easily finds ways to show me time and time again, throughout my life, how incredibly blessed I am.  
        
      I am thankful for the job and housing situation the Lord brings to me and my future wife.  
        
      And lastly, Katy, I'm thankful for you and the great works coming from your fingertips. Look forward to a good read... (estimate date?)  
        
      God Bless everyone, and have a great Thanksgiving!

      I'm thankful for the expensive, private college I go to, will graduate from relatively soon, and more importantly, the sacrifice my parents make to pay for it.  
        
      I noticed that you used the word trepidatious, which made me smile because its one of my favorite non-words, and it often describes me well. So much in fact, that I used it in my blog address.

      I'm glad you guys were brave enough to my thanksgiving excercise. My husband thought it was a little kooky of me to pose such a question. Well!  
        
      Lindsey--I did not mean to steal your non-word! I have visited your site more than once, and had not noticed "trepidatious" in your url. You are a very insightful girl, I think. From now on, I will credit you when I use our non-word, and proudly!

Okay, friends, before you pick up that fried turkey leg or dive into the mashed potatoes, it's time to go around the blogospherical table and tell us what you're thankful for!  
  
Only instead of telling what you're thankful for from the past year, or that you're most thankful for that fantastic pumpkin cheescake sitting over on the buffet, tell us what you're thankful for that's still in the future.  
  
I know, I know. You'll have to go out on a limb here. Believe me, so will I.  
  
But I'm thinking that thinking thankfully about our own futures might inspire a bit of faith and courage in even the most trepidatious among us. And if trepidatious isn't a word, by the way, it should be.  
  
So. I'm thankful that I'm going to be eagerly working with a like-minded editor to get my novel ready to publish, and that I'm going to finish a second one before the next Thanksgiving rolls around.  
  
There's a Scripture I'm thankful for, too, and it's a promise for the future. "He who began a good work in you, will be faithful to complete it."  
  
Yes. I'm very thankful. And trepidatious. How about you?
