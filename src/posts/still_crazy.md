      So sweet... I'm forever thankful for my kilt-clad hubby who, like me, knows the joy that comes from the music of the Highlands. :) Happy anniversary, Katy and Doug!!!!!

![Uilleann Pipes](img/pipes.jpg)I was crazy in love with the guy, and I just couldn't help myself.  
  
Still, what kind of a man would calmly deny his fiancee's built-in, ancestral need to have bagpipers play at their wedding? What kind of a man--musical genius that he was even then--seriously thinks that bagpipes screech? What kind of a man?  
  
What kind of a man insists on violins to warm up the wedding congregants (who are, let's be honest, not Italian, but Scottish and Irish) and classical guitar for the bride to walk down the aisle?  
  
The kind who, twenty-six years to the day later, wants me to come with him to historic Weston, Missouri, to take his bagpipes in for a little tune-up, that's what kind.  
  
The kind who sometimes has second thoughts, and valuable ones at that, and relents. The kind who knows we have three grown kids to marry off, and there's a good chance bagpipes will figure in yet, and that I'll cry the tears only bagpipes at weddings can induce, and that he'll love it when I do.  
  
I knew exactly what kind of a man he was, even then. The kind I'd stay so crazy in love with, I wouldn't be able to help myself.
