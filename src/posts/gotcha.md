      This has nothing at all to do with anything, but am I the only one having trouble reading the comments here? The background is really dark all of a sudden...but no one else seems to be mentioning it. When I leave a comment the background is white...To read comments I have to highlight the blogback page to see them...  
        
      Other blogs using blogback's commenting system I have no trouble reading, so I'm just curious if it's the result of recent "redesigns" or tinkering....or if it's just me going blind..

      First to stick with another Michael, black on blue makes it tough to read.  
        
      Second  
      I'm a sucker for wine labels. Get hooked by a pretty bottle. Rarely is the wine any good.  
        
      Take Care

Now we're trying to figure out how to move to a new comments thingie without losing all the great comments here from 4 years of blogging! Any suggestions besides cut and paste?"

      I know what you mean about great titles. I once found a Christian group called "Mercy River" in the discount bin at my local bookstore. OK, so the group was not actually ensconced in the bin. It was one of their CDs.  
        
      I picked up the CD and casually scoured for anythig remotely interesting. I was about to put the disk down when a near life-changing title caught my eye:  
        
      The song was called "Elvis has left the Building; Jesus is coming soon."  
        
      I just had to buy me that CD. It was not only a great title but the song fulfilled its promise. It's nice when life works out like that. Best $5 I ever spent.

      Yes, Katy, sometimes the cover or title jumps  
      out at me, and says, "buy me, buy me." But  
      I always take time to read the back cover, and the first few pages. Right now everyone and anybody is telling me to read Joel Osteens book. Who the heck is Joel Olsteen, or Osteen?' I know he is a minister, that is all I know. I guess he is the new guru.

I know you can't judge a book by its cover, at least not in any ultimate sense. But it sure is tempting, isn't it?  
  
I'm going to admit here and now that on more than one occasion, I've judged a book on just a portion of its cover--its title, to be exact.  
  
Every once in a while, a title jumps off the cover at me and so impresses and delights me with its cleverness that I rush to the clerk in a frenzy to purchase the book posthaste! Today was one of those days.  
  
Here's the title that snagged my bucks: "Some Writers Deserve To Starve!" (Sub-title: "31 Brutal Truths About the Publishing Industry")  
  
Does this ever happen to you, or am I just an easy mark?
