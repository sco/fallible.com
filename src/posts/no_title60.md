      it's all in the \_speaking into belief\_, wise katy. <br><br>or in some cases, \_writing into belief.\_<br><br>(if anyone can do it, you can.)

I just found myself giving a bit of encouragement to a fellow writer, one who may not be certain she's up to the literary task she's taking on. "If anyone can do it, you can," I say, in exactly the same enthusiastic tone a writing professor once used with me. In fact, even the words are identical. How is it that I am capable of passing on a message of hope and confidence, but rarely believe a similar message if directed toward me? Maybe I've missed my calling. Are there Christian channellers?
