"Hi, babe..." he mumbles.  
  
My groggy husband, who worked until after midnight, is having a hard time waking up this morning. I've been up a couple of hours, though. I've done all my morning things, and have now decided to read on the couch in our bedroom.  
  
"Hi, honey," I say. "It's morning."  
  
"Did you sleep OK?" he asks.  
  
"Great," I say. "It seemed like you slept well, too."  
  
"Yeah," he says, "I did."  
  
Thirty seconds later:  
  
"Hi, babe..." he mumbles.  
  
"Um...didn't we already have this conversation?"  
  
"Yeah," he says, "but I woke up again."
