I sent her my bread dough spoon. A great large beast that's been with me through many a loaf, large enough to spoon out a huge dollop of blessings whenever needed. Thank you for your poem. It's lovely."

It’s just a slotted spoon, of course,  
Nothing more.  
Wooden handled, sturdy and  
Steady as she goes, and went.

Vintage 1950, when housewives  
Stirred oatmeal old-fashioned,  
Stick-to-ribs, sturdy and  
Steady as she goes, and went.

She scraped potatoes from a  
Heavy pot, smoothed soup  
Into soothing cures, sturdy and  
Steady as she goes, and went.

Scooped Irish stew into steaming  
Bowls, set before us with Wonder  
Bread and peaches, sturdy and  
Steady as she goes, and went.

Alone at last, she scrambled  
A solitary egg, that’s all, to make  
Things simple, sturdy and  
Steady as she goes, and went.

The spoon went with her to the  
Tiny kitchenette. She never stirred  
Another thing, sturdy and  
Steady as she goes, and went.

I touch it now, and feel her palm  
Upon the handle’s grain, her fingerprints  
Beneath my own, sturdy and  
Steady as she goes, and went.

It’s just a slotted spoon, of course,  
Nothing more.  
Wooden handled, sturdy and  
Steady as she goes---and went.
