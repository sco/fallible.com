      Katy, tell me about your book! Is there somewhere I can read about it? Can I order it for review and maybe interview you about it on the radio? Let me know. :)

      Girl, You are so nice! It's not published yet. It's currently in the hands of several editors, so we'll see. I won't forget your offer in the future, though...  
        
      About the book: I call it "My Lawful Wedded Life." It's' the story of a Sandwich Generation couple who, between their still-needy nearly-grown kids, their cantankerous parents, and their careers, are just trying to carve out a little life for themselves. It's a comedy.  
        
      Thanks, Cindy!

      Tim--It means a lot, especially if you add to it that you will buy my book when it gets published. Oh, yeah. Then it really means a lot. :)  
        
      Jennifer--I like the several virtual book tours I've seen recently, like RealLivePreacher's. I may try to organize something like that when the time comes. Then you can comment, and I'll sign a book for you on the virtual spot, and mail it to you! Thanks for letting me dream.  
        
      Lisa--I finished NaNo three years ago. Two years ago, I started but did not finish. Last year I didn't do NaNo, but I was seriously writing my novel at that time. My novel didn't include any of the stuff I wrote for the two NaNos. I still think it's a valuable experience, just to prove to yourself that you CAN keep your derrierre in a chair that long. I hope you see your way clear to try it!

Conzoleezza Rice is my age, and is considered a "young woman" in her new position as Secretary of State.  
  
I'm Condoleezza Rice's age, and considered an old woman, having just written my first novel.  
  
Some poetic justice.
