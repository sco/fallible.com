So I'm watching Kansas City's KCTV 5's Five O'Clock show. It's amazing how few minutes it takes till you're pretty sure it's a "no news" day. By 5:10, the reporter was doing a story on "space cleaners." A space cleaner, for the uninitiated, is a professional who enters your home (or workplace, I suppose) and performs a series of rituals to rid the area of bad vibes, unwanted ghosts, etc. First off, the reporter says, the practitioner sets up a makeshift altar with candles and incense. Then she moves through the building room by room, waving what appears to be a wand over furniture, walls, windows and doors while chanting appropriate incantations. The homeowner follows the mystic around, but says nothing, though from the approving look on her face, she is quite satisfied with a job well done. "I guarantee my work," says the mystic. "But of all my dozens of clients, no one's ever asked for her money back." There are only 200 known space cleaners in the United States, so we are indeed fortunate to have attracted one to our fair city. Her fee? Four hundred bucks. Almost makes a person wish for a "news" day.
