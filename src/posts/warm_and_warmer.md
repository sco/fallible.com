![hot jammies](http://www.fallible.com/img/thumbnails/jammies.gif)I'm in the middle (I can only presume) of a headache from hell. This is Day Five, I think, but who knows, really? All the days and nights become one big light-sensitive, vision-impaired, pain-down-to-my-teeth blur.  
  
Last fall, I found out through a spinal tap that I test borderline for a bizarre condition called "pseudotumor cerebri." I test borderline for lots of bizarre stuff, so that information by itself wouldn't alarm me.  
  
But the headaches do.  
  
For two days, I've been freezing, and can't get warm no matter what I try. I don't have a fever. It's more like I'm recoiling from the extreme pain by shriveling up into a golfball-sized hailstone.  
  
I finally gave up my usually high spirits around one in the afternoon, and told Doug I was going to put on my softest cotton knit pajamas and call it a very long day.  
  
I was already inwardly berating myself for getting so little done, for writing almost nothing at all, for letting this thing get the best of me.  
  
Why did I imagine he was doing the same?  
  
"Not yet," he said, taking the pajamas from my hands.  
  
The next thing I knew, he had popped my pj's into the dryer.  
  
"Let me get them nice and warmed up for you."  
  
All the days and nights become a blur, but the gentle kindness of a good man restores clarity to my heart.
