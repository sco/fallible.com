      Of course, I'm eating an orange right now... From a lunch that I had to pack myself, mind you. But, yeah, those slippery Smiths can be quite tricky.  
        
      As the apple asks, "Am I too far from the tree...er...fridge? Naw, this apple is where it is meant to be."

Sometimes I make it through that third day, but more often than not...and i read that you should quarter and core an apple, then press it all beck together and put in in it's baggie, it won't turn brown this way. right...maybe if you rubber banded the thing. so much for inspiration..."

      Tim, Nothing better than a self-sufficient man!  
        
      Bet, Kevin is coddled and he knows it. And he likes it, too. But the jig's about up for that kid....  
        
      Lisa, I am SO cheap! I can count the times on two hands any of my kids got to buy Mr. Goodcents or CiCi's pizza at school. And yet, I'll call Kev when he's on his way home, and have him pick up some carry-out.....Go figure.

I awaken abruptly from a so-detailed-it-had-to-be-real dream about my mother and stumble to the kitchen, my eyes slits.  
  
I fumble for the light more out of habit than need, since it only helps me to see in the dark when my eyes are open.  
  
I pack Kevin's lunch perfunctorily, being in my twenty-seventh straight year of packing lunches. Sandwich. Chips. Cookies. Fruit Gushers. I stumble to the fridge for yogurt and an apple.  
  
I pick up the yogurt first, squinting at it to make sure it's strawberry, since Kev would not enjoy something called "Black Forest Cherry."  
  
I reach for the apple bag with the same hand that holds the yogurt. Looking back, I see this is where I first went wrong.  
  
I have a vague but salient thought about how there is only one more apple in the bag, which makes me happy today is Friday. An apple for Monday, but after that, a trip to the Chopper.  
  
I grasp the apple with the yogurt-filled hand, but the Granny Smith eludes me, slips from my fingers before even making good contact, hits the floor with a thud.  
  
I hear two more thuds but see no apple. The slippery Smith has rolled under the open fridge door, and has landed--I am certain--under the adjoining cabinet.  
  
I groan to picture the nasty bruises the apple will display after thudding thrice, and consider passing it off to Kev anyway. Does a high school senior stop to examine his apple before plunging in? I think not.  
  
I close the door and begin the search, a long and grueling one--life changing in many ways, since it is performed completely without benefit of caffeine. It is the kind of ordeal that convinces a woman what she's made of.  
  
I find the wayward fruit half a world away, around a corner in the living room, wedged into a crevice where the wood floor meets the carpet. Propped against the wall on the floor is a picture Doug has been meaning to hang, and so the apple loiters at the very edge of "God Bless Our Home."  
  
I leave it there, a stark and graphic lesson of some kind, but what?  
  
The apple doesn't fall far from the tree, but it falls far indeed from the fridge.
