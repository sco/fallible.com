      So how does it work from here? Is there a bathing suit competition or do you have answer some silly question like: "If you were a tree...."?  
        
      Congratulations!

      You people are beautiful! Not sure if there are many more hoops to jump through in this contest--a swimsuit comp would have definitely precluded me from entering! Eeewwww!  
        
      The group gets narrowed to 10, and then those ten are sent to Tyndale (who publishes the winner) for them to choose the final one. The whole thing has been a tremendous lot of fun, and has moved me into fiction-writing as a first love.  
        
      Not counting blogging, of course, Irene. Tee, hee.

      LaShawn, Somehow I think a book is in your future! And I hope a book by you is in ours....  
      I don't know when mine might be published yet, but I'll let you know!  
        
      Bug, Thanks!

Many of you know that I finished my first novel in January and entered it in a contest sponsored by the Christian Writers Guild. While the grand prize winner won't be announced until the end of June, I received a *very fun* interim email from the Guild last Friday.  
  
Out of 290 entries, my story has made it to the top 20! So, that's something, isn't it?
