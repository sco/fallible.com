      Though I enjoy reading your writing, today's comment is truly fallible. As a black woman (the word they were using when I was growing up) I find your generalizations offensive, but as a Christian woman, I find them disheartening and painful. To think that the entire black community considers the "down low" as something acceptable or even real is going too far. In any community, racial, religious or political, there will always be those  
      who exploit that community for their own gain. I hope that you will not join that group. The tone of some of your comments lately make me wonder. :)  
        
      Many blessings to you and yours,  
      Mary Griffith

      Mary and Drina,  
      From what I know of the down low, I completely realize that this is not a widely accepted practice--or even necessarily a phenomenon accepted as "real"-- in the black community. As I watched the Oprah show on the subject, the cameras frequently panned the audience, and came to rest on many stunned faces. Some ladies in the audience seemed to have never heard of this lifestyle, and shook their heads in disbelief and sadness over the terrible statistics about disease and family devastation occurring among them.  
        
      I thought back to this show as I watched Gov. McGreevey stand holding hands with his wife, announcing to the world that he is a "gay American." It seemed to me (especially after reading that he had asked gay activists to help him craft his statement--though who knows how true that is) that McGreevey was shaping his comments in terms that he felt would be most palatable to the public, and would perhaps paint him in a more acceptable light as he faced the charges he knew were coming. He played the trump card, the words "gay American," which felt much more disengenuous to me than the guy on Oprah who claimed that he wasn't gay, but lived on the down low, because he "liked it."  
        
      Meanwhile, McGreevey's wife wore the same stunned expression of the women in Oprah's audience. When I wrote this post, I couldn't help comparing her lot with that of the disturbed women on Oprah--and how it seemed like none of them knew quite what to believe about their men's claims.  
        
      I'm sorry I offended you. I really appreciate you weighing in with your take on my post. I only meant to compare the "excuses" used by the man on Oprah and Gov. McGreevey. "I like it" seems more honest to me than "I am a gay American," which smacks of the overly-politicized.

Poor New Jersey Governor James McGreevey. If only he was black, he wouldn't have to resort to identifying himself as a statesmanlike-sounding "gay American."  
  
If only he was black, he could just say he's living on the [down low](http://www.oprah.com/tows/pastshows/200404/tows_past_20040416.jhtml) and be done with it.
