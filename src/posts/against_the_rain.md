If I'm sitting in one spot and the dark storm clouds are moving fast, alternating with spots of blue sky and bright sun, I'm miserable. The rapidly shifting barometric pressure in my head is so unbearable that I'm often reduced to a pill-popping, praying, trembling specimen of womankind.  
  
The only thing redeeming about the situation is that I don't need my favorite weatherman Gary Lezak at KSHB-TV in Kansas City to tell me what's about to happen. I've got Dopplar radar beat all to heck, and could save the NBC affiliate oodles of bucks, if they'd only tap into my early-alert system.  
  
From now on, though, I'm going to stick a wet finger into the wind before I get in a car and drive sixty miles per hour on a day like today, unless it's in the *same* *direction* the storm is moving.  
  
What just happened inside my head felt something like a sudden-onset insanity with a cranial explosion on the side, just to make it colorful.  
  
That'll teach me to go against the rain.
