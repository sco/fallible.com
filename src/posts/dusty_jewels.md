      it's always encouraging to read about real, Christian families who really love Jesus. One day, not only will my parents love God, but my own family that I will eventually have, will serve Him too.

![](http://www.fallible.com/guitar.gif)"We bow down..."  
  
I hear Doug playing his guitar as I walk by the closed door of his office. The sound of his instrument is sweet and his voice is pure as he worships in the late evening hour.  
  
I don't interrupt him, though. I'm on a mission, hunting down my son Kevin, determined to put him on the straight and narrow path of homework.  
  
"We lay our crowns..."  
  
This is a thankless job, I think. Always staying on top of the kids, their schedules, their assignments, their assorted car wrecks. Any crown I might receive for this seems a long time in coming.  
  
"At the feet of Jesus."  
  
I walk farther from the scene of worship, sure Kevin's around here somewhere, eluding me and his responsibilities. I bet he's taking a nap, when he *knows* he's got work to do.  
  
"The wonder of His mercy and love, at the feet of Jesus..."  
  
The music fades as I move away from it. I'm angry that he isn't responding when I call down to his room. I make a beeline back to the office now, to report my frustration to my peaceable husband, and I'm turning the doorknob when the vocal harmonies begin.  
  
"We cry holy, holy, holy..."  
  
I gasp, and collapse on the hard wood floor, and am silent.  
  
"We cry holy, holy, holy..."  
  
I cry tears of thanksgiving for a son who has chosen, like Mary the sister of Martha, to sit at the feet of his Savior.  
  
"We cry holy, holy, holy, is the Lord."  
  
And all my crowns lie in the dust.
