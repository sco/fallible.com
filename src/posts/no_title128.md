      You are SUCH an incredible writer, Katy! I had some extra moments tonight for the first time in a very, very long time, and your blog was the first one I wanted to do some catching up on. Unfortunately I won't get to catch up all the way tonight, but I'm glad I have gotten to read some. You get me with pretty much every post and I just love being able to sit here and have my way of thinking continually remolded each time I read one of your blog entries. Yes, I do think I've gotten a great bargain from it.

Have you ever stopped to consider your own mortality? I stopped once, and didn't start moving again for about thirty years. I've felt ill enough for my entire adult life that I've been forced into a condition of habitual mortality consideration. Believe me, it's overrated. But I'm well now, reborn for the second glorious time. Fully alive for what feels like the first time. The rampant morbid thoughts have all died down. When I throw I load of laundry into the wash, I don't automatically enter the cycle of "I need to get this caught up in case I die." When I'm making a lasagne, I don't feel compelled to make five, so a few meals will be in the freezer for my family "in case I die." Come to think of it, I rarely end any thought at all with the words "in case I die." I've come to see, in my new life these last couple of years, that there are only two reasons for considering one's mortality. The first is to know where you're going after you die. And the second is to know what you're doing before you die. Don't get me wrong. I still consider. I just don't stop to consider.
