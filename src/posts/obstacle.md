    text: "Katy, I love your writings. Esp. how you describe your husband...just makes me chuckle. I must confess I started reading your blog because my husband put your site on MY blog as \"other blogs I read\". Since it was on there, I figured I'd better not lie, but actually start reading your blog. That was a couple weeks ago, and now I'm HOOKED. Thanks, hubby!"

![Prolific](img/bookshelf.jpg)Doug is designing a website for my lovely author friend, who's published eight or nine books, and has several more in the pipeline. I only envy her a little, really.  
  
"*I* should have books, shouldn't I?" I wistfully ask him, as I watch him work in Photoshop.  
  
"Mm-hmmm..." he says, as supportive as ever.  
  
"Instead, I have a big butt."  
  
No wonder he's speechless.
