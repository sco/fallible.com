He has on his tropical print shirt again today, because he knows we'll be stopping by Starbucks.  
  
It's hard to resist the compliments of the young female baristas, who say, in that way that sounds like it's fishing for a tip, "*Nice shirt*, Doug."  
  
I've started calling it his lucky shirt.  
  
Today, though, I'm looking way past where the young girls could ever see, past the maroon-and-cream flowered 100% rayon, into his mind and heart, into the part of him that doesn't really think much about baristas at all.  
  
"You're an elegant man, Doug," I say.  
  
He reaches out and takes my hand. "You're funny," he says.  
  
"No, really," I say. "And I'm not just talking about your shirt, either."  
  
I'm not talking about his shirt at all.
