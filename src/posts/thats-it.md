    text: "You are my heroine of the well-turned phrase, Katy. When you say \"I am more impressed with a deep knowledge than a broad one\" immediately that registers and I'm nodding in agreement. We gravitate to your writing because you express the sentiment of our hearts even better than we can. This makes for a beautiful writer-reader connection. â¥"

It would be lovely, wouldn’t it, if we could truly know everything we’ve seen, if nuances whispered their meanings to us in the light where we could at least read their lips, rather than in the darkness where we must also depend on interpreting their touch. It would be lovely, but too easy. I am more impressed with a deep knowledge than a broad one, even if that which is fully known by me is not unlike what is known by any other person living in this world. I would rather read one phrase which aptly captures love, and about which anyone might say “that’s it!” than a library full of poetry which almost touches my soul. The one beautiful thing about the “almosts,” though, is the way they challenge me to try the thing myself. To try myself to fashion the one apt phrase which, after it’s written, I might read again, and sigh and say, that’s it.
