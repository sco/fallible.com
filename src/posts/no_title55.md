I'm sitting here looking out on my vast yard, made green again by the latter rains. The profusion of rabbits amazes me. (The squirrels used to outnumber them, but no more.) The rabbits travel alone, hopracing a half-acre at a time, then furtively crashing into the expanse of trees. As soon as one exits my field of vision, the next one enters it, until they seem to be criss-crossing the lawn like race cars on a video game. Suddenly, they disappear, and a huge blond dog takes center stage. He gallops to an empty spot, stops, looks, listens, sniffs, and lurches off again. "Look at that crazy dog," I say. "What is he *doing*?" "Chasing rabbit," Doug says. The hapless dog finally wanders off, and the rabbits come back out to play. And I'm sitting here wondering: Am I more like the ditzy dog, who chases but has never caught a thing in his life, or the rabbits, who spend all their effort avoiding being caught? To chase, or to be chased. That is the question.
