      Who's the genius who came up with this wonderful idea? I look forward to reading more.  
        
      I tried to comment on Doug's post, figuring that as a first time blogger, he'd appreciate it more, but the link to the comments didn't seem to work for me. So tell him hello from me, that I read his entry, and I'm wondering why it took so long for him to venture into blogging.

      Rebecca--You and Kevin have both caught glitches. I will give Doug your message, and refer the tech problem to him, as well...  
        
      As for which one of us is the genius, well. We just started talking last week, and one sentence led to another, and this is what we came up with! We're equally to blame, if I remember correctly... :)  
        
      Doug is a wonderful, insightful writer! You'll be reading much more from him going forward.

*Finally.* The day I've been waiting for lo these many long years has arrived! My hubby Doug has started blogging. You can find his thoughts at [marginalcomments.com](http://www.marginalcomments.com), where he's hoping you'll leave lots of comments of your own!  
  
From this day forward, whenever you see a clickable icon beside one of our posts, you'll know that the other one of us has written a companion post. Our idea is to start our respective entries with the same quote, then to be surprised and delighted by the vast discrepancies in the way our minds work.  
  
We're not going to talk about the quote before we write, and we'll only see each other's entries after they're written.  
  
It should be a fun look at how even two people who think alike on almost nothing can enjoy a happy long-term marriage.  
  
The two shall become one, yes indeed. *Which* one is the question.
