      Hey there - I haven't been reading with you for long, but my wife, Lisa J., is an avid reader.  
        
      I am also currently working on a novel, and I was glad to hear that you finished yours. A word of caution, however, on sequels. Editors and agents uniformly suggest that when a writer finishes a book, NOT to start on a sequel immediately. Why? First novels of writers often go unpublished (even Stephen King wrote three before one got published) and if they do get published, they typically don't sell out the advance, meaning a publisher doesn't want a sequel. So, my advice, like so many others, is to start an entirely new project, and then if your first novel is actually published and successful, then write a sequel. Your writing as a whole is infinitely more marketable this way.  
        
      Just two cents. :)

    text: "Isaac, Many thanks for your input. I did not know that this was the conventional advice, but it makes perfect sense. I had wondered about this very thing. What would be the point of ending up with two books that didn't sell, if you could hold it down to only one? Hmmm....Now I'm seriously rethinking. I've started sequel, but could easily put it aside for the time being. Thanks, and best wishes with your novel. Hi to Lisa, too!"

      I'm lucky to have my little sister as my best friend. I can only hope the reverse is true! ;)  
      Wow... it's really weird to discover that your friend and his wife (also a good friend) read your favorite blog, and never mentioned it to you. (Hi, Isaac! Hi Lisa!)

"The baby's here," my mother said, "and it's a girl!"  
  
Mom had left our house in a snow storm, alone. A taxi driver took her to Baptist Memorial Hospital. My father could not go with her--doctor's orders. He was recovering from his first heart attack, and the excitement might have been too much for him.  
  
So my father and I and my two little sisters and one little brother spent a long day waiting by the phone, only five minutes away from my mother by car, stuck.  
  
"Everyone gets to vote," Mom said, "Shall we name her Bridget Colleen, Bridget Maureen, or Valerie Jane?"  
  
I still remember thinking how incredibly brave my mother was, to go to the hospital alone like that, facing what I was sure must be agonizing discomfort, with no husband pacing back and forth in the new fathers' waiting room, like men used to do.  
  
Getting to vote on our baby sister's name was by far the most democratic event that had ever occured in our family. Hilarious glee broke out as we took the tally. I bet Mom could have heard us cheering even without benefit of an aqua princess phone.  
  
Happy 37th Birthday, little Bridget Colleen! By the way, the vote was unanimous.
