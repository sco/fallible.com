My daughter Carrie has a job at the hospital in the town where she goes to college. Her job is as a "sitter" for patients who can't be left alone.  
  
After her first day, she told us she'd been assigned to care for "mutes and loonies." She said it with a lot of love.  
  
Today, I asked if she'd met anyone interesting lately in the men department. She said sure, there were guys hitting on her, all right, but they were all "pigs and perverts." She didn't say it with a lot of love.  
  
Mutes and loonies, pigs and perverts. What a life.
