      Then there's those of us who may not have "community" in our title, but still work for public (the kids, their parents, the principal, the board members...need I go on?) and have the pay that goes with it...it's a good thing I love what I do because I'm certainly not in it for the money. I really HATE those lists.

It amazes me that someone who spends 8-10 hours a day with little ones or seniors makes so little money (I haven't read this year's article yet but in the past, they list daycare workers making less than $20K.) I guess it has to do with the skill level required for those jobs or something . . ."

      Welcome to the Free Market Economy. :)  
        
      Doesn't mean it is right, just how it is. I'd much rather anything dealing with communities or ministries be paid poorly and supplemented through donations, volunteer work, etc. than the government stepping in and forcing equal pay on everyone. Or something like that.

Parade Magazine--a supplement to Sunday newspapers across the U.S.--has a recurring cover story I just can't get enough of called "What People Earn: A Special Report."  
  
They run an updated version of their special report every six months or so, replete with scores of pics of typical wage-earners, including their annual incomes and their professions.  
  
They always throw in a few movie stars, rock stars and sports celebrities just to inspire class envy in the rest of us. We ask ourselves which chick is worth her pay: 18-year-old Lindsay Lohan, who currently pulls down $10 million a year, or Jessica Simpson, who at age 24 almost seems like a has-been with a measly take of $4 million. Of course, both of them make peanuts compared to Lance Armstrong, who's hanging in there at a cool $19 million.  
  
But when I recover from my momentary star envy, I check out the regular folks. And that's where the mysteries really abound. How is it that someone with a position as important-sounding as a "Public Health Administrator" in Columbia, Missouri only makes $25,000 per year, and an airport screener (presumably a very important job in our day and age) makes $29,800, but a mortgage broker is worth $280,000?  
  
I've made several visits to mortgage brokers in my day, and the way I remember the transactions, I ended up doing all the work of supplying every bit of my personal financial history to them and then signing my life away, to boot. And I only refinance if there's "no cost" to me--so where the heck are they getting the $280,000 paycheck?  
  
I don't mind a power-plant worker making $125,000, since it seems like those are guys we want to keep on our side, and a power-grid operator makes even more--$162,000--which seems like a small price to pay to keep brown-outs from rolling.  
  
I think a cracker-jack probation officer is worth every cent of $65,000. But I'm still puzzled to think a tow-boat captain tows in $85,000 besides whatever else it is that a tow-boat captain tows.  
  
How many boats would a tow-boat tow if a tow-boat could tow boats? (Sorry. I couldn't resist.)  
  
It's the low-paying jobs that shock me the most. It seems that all the positions with the word "community" in them are terribly compensated for all their good intentions. A "community advocate"(is anyone really AGAINST community?) scrapes by on $18,600.  
  
And a driver's ed instructor seems like a critical profession to me, yet the one profiled only drives away with 25 grand.  
  
Each time this story appears, they include one writer in the bunch, just to infuse us wordsmiths with some angsty emotion to fuel our writing for the next few days. This time, it's a horror writer in Berkeley, California who's 33 years old and compensated for his efforts a crummy $18,500 year. I wonder which came first: the horror writing or the horrible pay?  
  
All I can hope for the poor guy is that maybe he's lucky enough to be married to the woman who's making $105,000 as a pet-boutique owner. Can you imagine the horror of trying to live in Berkeley on less than 20 grand?  
  
You may have noticed that I don't have a donation button on my site, and I'm not accepting advertising--yet--but that doesn't mean I wouldn't like to sell a few manuscripts and live like royalty--oops, I mean "on royalties."  
  
But I need to face facts. Whenever Parade Magazine does their story on "What People Earn," writers are always down there at the bottom of the heap. If I was doing this for money, well, I wouldn't be doing it.  
  
Still, it's good to know that Doug is thriving in his position as an, um...hold on a second...  
  
"Hey, Doug, tell me again--what do you call what you're do for a living?"  
  
"You mean, Knowledge Management Consultant And E-Business Systems Analyst?"  
  
Yeah. What he said.  
  
If I'm going to be a podunk writer, it's a darned good thing he's...not.
