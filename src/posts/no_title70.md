You have to give God credit, really. Imagine the strategic planning, the artistic ability, the attention to millions upon millions of minute details that combined to create everything we see--and everything we don't. Imagine Him fashioning the earth for His pleasure and then, not quite as pleased as He could be, creating us to make His joy complete. Who else but God could find ultimate pleasure in what we consider to be no more than products of conception, by-products of carnal indulgences, beings who consist of nothing but the sum of their dubious parts? His thoughts are so far above ours, you really have to give Him credit.
