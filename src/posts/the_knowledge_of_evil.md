You know it's bad when on a Friday night your air conditioner--which has been wheezing spasmodically for a couple of weeks--gasps its last, and service calls cost three times as much on the weekend.  
  
You know it's worse when you fling open your bedroom window and turn on the attic fan, resigned to a long weekend of heat and humidity and bizarre allergic reactions.  
  
You know it's tragic when, within five minutes of flinging and fanning, a dozen dogs start barking and a skunk sprays outside said window.  
  
You just know.
