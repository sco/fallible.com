      kids say the loveliest things...yesterday at our prayer before dinner, my almost six year old prayed "and God, thank you that we don't have to sleep in doorways". from where such and idea came into his head, i don't know...but it sure is something to be thankful for.

Mom's still in the hospital, taking even *more* mood-altering drugs than she was before--all in an effort, of course, to stabilize not only her problems with depression and anxiety, but her seizure disorder and other medical issues.  
  
As a result--which we can only hope is temporary--she is quite unsteady when she tries to walk.  
  
This wasn't lost on her ten-year-old grandson, Brendan, when he visited her and, with his dad, helped her take a little stroll.  
  
"What did you think of your grandma?" I asked the lad on the phone yesterday.  
  
I'm so glad I asked, because his response gave me a great story to share with my mom, who laughed her head off when I told her.  
  
"Oh, I thought she was doing pretty OK," he said, rather philosophically for a young man of his age. "Except that when she walks, she *swivels*."  
  
Always, always, beauty from ashes.
