A year ago, my family's life was changed when we welcomed [two girls from Northern Ireland](http://www.thecraicsgreat.com) into our home to live with us for six weeks' time. Last night, we learned that one of them, our little Sheryl, has changed our lives again. All we can bring ourselves to do is to pray that her death "will be swallowed up in victory," as the Scripture says. From the archives: E.R. and The West Wing are always promising that if I just watch tonight's episode, it will "change my life forever." So I watch, and I wait, and I watch some more. Nothing. Sure, I'm entertained, satisfied for an hour, and maybe my belief system is even bolstered by the scriptwriters' obvious ideologies. But changed forever? Hardly. The things that change your life forever, I'm finding out, almost always arrive quietly, unannounced, without fanfare. They seldom turn out to be what you first take them for, and always end up being more than you could have ever dreamed. Chloe and Sheryl will go back home to the towns of Fintona and Sixmilecross, County Tyrone, Northern Ireland in just three days time. We've been so wrapped up in their lives, and they in ours, for these past six weeks, that I haven't once had the time or notion to watch E.R. or The West Wing. And our lives have been changed forever. posted Monday, August 06, 2001
