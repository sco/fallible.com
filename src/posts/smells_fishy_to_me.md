![](http://www.fallible.com/img/thumbnails/whale.gif)God asked Jonah to do a very simple thing, really.  
  
Just deliver a word of the Lord to Jonah's enemy, the great city of Nineveh. Tell them they'll be destroyed unless they repent. The destruction part Jonah was cool with. But the deal was, God couldn't be trusted. He was the Type who just might pour out his unfailing compassion on a whole nation, even if it made Jonah look like a fool.  
  
What a Guy.  
  
Four short chapters and three whole days in a whale later, if he had learned anything at all, Jonah would have had more compassion for the people God had mercy on than for the crummy little tree that withered up and died.  
  
When his source of shade disappeared, so did his new-found heart of praise.  
  
No wonder some people spend their entire lives lifting praises in the midst of fish guts.
