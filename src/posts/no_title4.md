Names say a lot about a person, don't you think? I just did a google search with the single word "Katy" to see what I'd turn up. (For one thing, fallible appeared 55th out of 801,000 Katy sightings, which was cool. And most of the first 30 or so pertain to the Katy Trail, the Katy Railroad, establishments in Katy, Texas, etc.) I experienced an instantanous affinity with these far-flung Katys, amazed at how nearly their interests and pursuits reflect mine. One Katy is a celtic musician, another a purveyor of heritage lace. A third Katy is a dollmaker, and a fourth a retailer of hand-dyed fabrics. There is a Katy, the water-colourist, and a Katy, the antique Singer sewing machine collector. And a Katy who assembles resources for writers. Of porn and erotica. OK, but still.
