      Starbucks on the Plaza is the best; it's definitely worth your while. Go there! Go there now!

Yesterday, I unplugged my laptop, stuck it in a bag, and hightailed it over to my closest Starbuck's to write among the bohemians. OK, so I'm not Hemingway or Fitzgerald, and Starbuck's isn't exactly a bar in Key West or a cafe in Paris. Still, the men play chess, and the women have their tete-a-tetes, and the fragrances of exotic coffees and a dozen different delectable pastries permeates the air. Ah, Paris! That is, until I looked up from my reverie and spotted the Oreck vacuum store and the Mail Boxes, Etc. store across the SUV-filled, devoid-of-vegetation parking lot. I'm thinking of trying the Starbuck's on the [Plaza](http://www.countryclubplaza.com/).
