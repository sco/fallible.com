Once, a long time ago now, a reader of mine linked to me from her blog. I saw the link among my referrers back then and went to her site, where she said of me, based completely on reading fallible, that I was a woman who "had the material for a novel."  
  
I'm sitting here before a blank screen thinking, If you're still out there, dear reader, email me. I need help.
