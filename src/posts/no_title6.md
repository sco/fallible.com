The window is not high, but wide, like the panorama-sized photos you can have developed these days. The view before dawn from the dimly lit room was like looking at an old-fashioned cartridge of Shaeffer's blue ink lying on its side. The ink had been black just minutes ago, India ink, the permanent kind, and now this. Blue ink, washable, changeable, lightening by the second, a color that would write a beautiful letter home. I sip my coffee and silently celebrate the mystery of it, and then take up my fountain pen to greet the day.
