If you ask your teenage son how he liked the movie Moulin Rouge, he'll probably say, "It was OK." If you inquire of your daughter whether or not she's gotten any emails from Sheryl and Chloe, her friends in Northern Ireland, she'll say something like, "No, not recently." If you wonder aloud how your adult son feels about theological issues or current events, you might want to save your breath. But don't worry. All is not lost. For complete answers to all your bewildering questions, you need look no farther than the comments boards on the blogs your kids visit. Or maybe an accidental peek at instant messanger, if one of them should happen to leave it running on your computer. Why, a couple of days ago, by digging deeply in a comments board, I even found out how one of my kids feels about birth control. I would have talked to him about it myself, but I'm still not sure how I feel about it. Suffice it to say that this, my friends, is why Al Gore invented the Internet.
