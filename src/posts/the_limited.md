      I totally agree about gift giving. Ah, how fun.  
        
      It's killing me that I have no job and therefore no income to spend on gifts this year, but I'm trying to allow it to push my focus more on the reason we're celebrating. Thank God his spending was limitless \[and still is\].

With the gift-giving season fully upon us, I've been thinking about spending limits.  
  
I overspend during the holidays. When the glitzy sales circulars start to circulate, I go and do likewise, making the rounds of stores with all the other crazies until I'm dizzy.  
  
I won't admit how many dollars I might spend just getting warmed up for the main event. By the time I have a clear idea of what I intend to purchase for each person on my list, I'm a hot shopper with empty pockets.  
  
"I figure we can spend x amount on each kid," I'll tell Doug when we're on the way to battle the crowds at Best Buy. What I don't exactly tell him is that I've already spent x and more at Kohl's, Old Navy, Barnes and Noble, and Target.  
  
It's just that gift giving is so darn much fun.  
  
What kind of joy must God the Father have felt when He personally delivered the best gift ever given, all wrapped up in that new baby smell?  
  
One thing's certain. He'd never heard of spending limits.
