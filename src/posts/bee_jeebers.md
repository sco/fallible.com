I love, love, love listening to the road reports on the radio during rush hour. In Kansas City and the surrounding area, trucks routinely roll, spilling their frequently-agricultural contents all over our fair highways.  
  
Recently, it was a truck full of chickens that, literally, crossed the road, disrupting traffic for hours. I'm thinking not too many drivers joked about it.  
  
Not long ago, vats of fresh, creamery butter made for a slippery commute. Passengers kept hopping out of cars to run into Denny's for a few croissants and a knife.  
  
This morning takes the prize, though. A truck full of 25 million bees burst open on contact with concrete, causing one whole strip of road to fade to black. All but one brave news reporter finally left the buzz behind, claiming they'd forgotten to take their Benedryl.  
  
Just thinking about it gives me hives.
