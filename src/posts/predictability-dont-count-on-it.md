Even if I'm into business at a very young age, I'm still hoping to pursue my dream. However, it seems like everything don't go according to my plan. Maybe, it's a way of God to let me know what's really my destiny. Who knows, maybe someday, I might fulfill my dream of becoming a bank officer (like my dad), right? But, as of now, I need to focus on what I'm enjoying."

By the way, you know how I haven't started birth conttrol because I am still nursing? Unpredictible is the understatement of our lives!! And who could have predicted this financial mess and wll the upheaval it has caused. Did I mention that my husband is currently in Germany working? Isn't it wonderful, though, that the God of heaven is always there to help us along the road of unpredictibility!! That the faithfulness of my spouse at 39 yrs is like the sun getting up in the morning. And that the love we have in our family helps each one through whatever current trial they are in be it joblessness or a challenging relocation or a medical scare? How do people without God and/or family manage in these times? I don't know, but I do know that I am blessed by the knowledge that God and His family and my family are there for support. Unpredictable, yes. Unbearable, never!"

I’ve never placed a high value on predictability, and it’s a good thing, too.

Sure, I like my husband to be the dependable type who shows up when he says he’s going to or calls to let me know he’s okay. I love it that, as a self-employed creative guy, he doesn’t decide to blow off work because he can or shirk his responsibilities to his clients or forget to bill them, hahaha.

He knows he can count on me to handle the bookkeeping for our business, to arrange get-togethers with our kids and our friends, to make sure our house, cars, and bodies are maintained on a regular basis, and to watch out for The Moms.

In those ways, our lives are predictable. But in so many hundreds of other ways, um, not so much.

I don’t think it’s an exaggeration to say that I had no idea when Doug and I got married that our lives would take the path they have. When we got engaged, Doug was mowing lawns for another man’s company, destined to break many otherwise serviceable lawn mowers because, well, he wasn’t cut out to be a lawn guy. He was a brilliant guitarist and songwriter, and soon to be an up-and-coming graphic designer. He just didn’t know it yet.

At the same time, I was a highly-compensated data recorder at a major pharmaceutical company, scribbling poetry on the side and getting in trouble for my distractibility. What “word” chick WOULDN’T be distracted by nothing but numbers, numbers, and more numbers all day long for five grueling years? Still, it never crossed my mind that someday I’d write even *one* novel, much less attract an agent and have the opportunity to pursue publication professionally.

I’ve grown to believe we do our children a great disservice when we urge them to structure their lives around the probability that events will occur precisely as they plan. We lead them to believe that if they go to college, get good grades, graduate with a degree in a high-paying field, and find a compatible mate, everything else in life will play out accordingly.

That’s just not always the case, though. Often, in spite of a young person’s ducks being in a neat and tidy row that’s supposed to be pointed toward a McMansion and a nanny for the kids, real life comes calling.

Real life is anything but predictable.

I’m glad Doug and I didn’t compose five, ten, fifteen, and twenty year plans, even though I guess by most people’s standards we’d be considered slackers. Honestly, sometimes next week is farther ahead than I want to look. Besides, I’ve always liked surprises, and life has turned out to have plenty of them.

I saw this in an essay by David Calderwood and thought it brilliant: “This lifelong illusion of predictability leaves us woefully unprepared for the abyss of reality.”

Is your life turning out as you thought it would, as you planned (if you planned)? Or has it taken directions you couldn’t anticipate in your younger years?

Would you rather lead a predictable life than not? If so, have you succeeded in making that happen? I’d love to know!
