Sadly, I realize they are synthetic stack heels, made to look stacked with grooves and slightly different colors, but not the genuine article.<br><br>Bridget--Eeeeewwwwww!"

"Got a belly ring yet?" asks JoAnn, my girlfriend these past thirty years.  
  
We haven't seen in other in quite a while. The low-rise Old Navy jeans, peasant top and stacked-heel boots must have fooled her.  
  
"No!" I laugh, then raise my eyebrows her way. She shakes her head. The red crocheted bell-sleeved sweater and the silver and turquoise jewelry must have fooled me.  
  
"Tatoos?" she persists, keeping a straight face. She is so like the girl I used to room with, so unchanged and unspoiled. And still unpredictable.  
  
"NO!" I shout, and then realize the more sedate patrons of Tippin's are staring. By now we are both giggling like the schoolgirls we were just moments ago.  
  
"Jo," I reason, "we don't even have extra holes in our ears..."  
  
"I've heard it's a good idea," she says,"to have an extra hole in just *one* ear--in case you lose an earring, you can still wear the other."  
  
She knows too well the response she'll get from me.  
  
"I've never lost an earring," I boast. And she, I'm thinking, has lost too many to count. So why doesn't *she* have an extra hole, I wonder. An extra hole is *just* what she needs...  
  
"And I always think I'll find mine," she deadpans. We laugh till we cry. The score is evened.  
  
I have to say that in this friendship of a lifetime, we've both found more than we've lost.
