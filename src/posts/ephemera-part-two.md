Fifteen or twenty years ago, Mom hand-wrote all of Dad’s poetry (but WHERE are the originals, hmmm?) and had them printed and bound into simple books at Kinko’s. I think she said it cost her $1 per copy, and there were only enough copies for her and each of us five kids.

I’ll never forget that Christmas, for I could not have received a gift I loved more. I may share more of my father’s poems as time goes by, but here is the letter to Hallmark Cards (a Kansas City-based company, of course) that Mom wrote when she and Dad were engaged, in 1950. Mom was only twenty years old at the time.

I love it because it so clearly demonstrates the confidence she felt in this scrappy immigrant’s talents, in his future, in his potential. By the way, for those wannabe-published readers who wonder how long it takes to hear back on your writing submissions? Judging by the date on this letter, um, 61 years and counting!

Sirs:

    In answer to your ad in Sunday’s paper for a verse writer, I would like to submit the enclosed poems written by a friend of mine. As you will see, these poems are written for special days such as birthdays, valentine day and Mother’s Day---themes which are suitable for greeting cards.

    My friend is a young Scotsman 28 years of age. He has a good character and education and studied poetry for recreation while in the Scotch regiment of the British army. He is very interested in getting a connection for selling his poems and has a real talent for writing for any occasion, both humorous and sentimental. He can write a poem quickly after getting an inspiration for a certain occasion.

    I have great faith in his talent and would consider it a great favor if you would interview him concerning this. May I hear from you soon?

                              Yours truly,

                              (Miss) Mary Pattengale  
                                      Highland View Farm
