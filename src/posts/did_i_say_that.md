Doug had a chance to play golf in a church tournament today, and it sounded like too much fun to pass up. I think he felt a little guilty about it, though, because he's been away more than usual recently.  
  
"But I'm really, really going to miss you," he said, in his typical romantic fashion.  
  
"Honey, you should go and have fun," I responded, sounding pretty convincing, if I do say so myself. "Don't worry about me. I'm used to being missed."  
  
Where do I come up with this stuff?
