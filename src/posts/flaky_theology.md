If you're planning a nice dinner for your Easter celebration this Sunday, you might already have mashed potatoes on your mind.  
  
But just in case you hadn't given spuds any serious thought lately, check out [Doug's entry](http://marginal.typepad.com/marginal/2005/03/flakey.html) today.  
  
I think you'll find it delicious!
