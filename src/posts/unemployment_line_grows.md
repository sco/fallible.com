![Send your resume to...](http://www.fallible.com/img/thumbnails/chicks.jpg)Poor Peter Arnett.  
  
All ties have been severed between him, NBC, MSNBC and National Geographic, the news agencies he reported to from Baghdad. He is suddenly, perhaps irretrievably, unemployed. Even the Iraqi state news agency to which he granted an interview has failed to offer him a position.  
  
He himself said in a conversation with Matt Lauer this morning that an uninhabited island might be just the place for him.  
  
Don't be so hard on yourself, Peter. Something will turn up. Have you thought about managing the Dixie Chicks?
