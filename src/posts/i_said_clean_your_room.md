      Katy,  
      I am enjoying Scott's adventure. He seems like a great person. You should be very, very proud.

      Bethany, I'm thinking ANY Richard Simmons would stop them, robotic or not!  
        
      James, I believe I'm prouder by the day, if that's possible. Thanks!  
        
      Tim, There are some oddball, kooky commenters in these parts, that's for sure. New camera, huh? We bought him this one! (Actually, a cheaper model and he upgraded.) Besides, evidently I'm going to have to spring to get his car out of hock. It's always something. ;)

Tell me this:  
  
Why is it that a mom is never quite sure she wants to know that her son is sleeping in a $3 dingy room with a fan in Bangkok? Is it love, or is it something else?  
  
Even if it's something else, the truth is that I am madly in love with [Scott Raymond, Gentleman Adventurer](http://www.scottraymondgentlemanadventurer.com/).
