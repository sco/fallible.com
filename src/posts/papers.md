      Burt Reynolds, naked?! Myohmyohmy! I was delighted with the phrase "plethora of ephemera," but a naked Burt Reynolds definitely takes the cake. God bless your mother for providing such quality entertainment.

      Bridget--Ah, yes. "We Were the McKennas."  
        
      Lisa--I don't know. We should go from glory to glory, I've read. Doug and I seem to be going from gory to gory. Tomorrow's another day digging out HIS mother's house......sigh.  
        
      Blue--One thing I've learned is that one can never be too sure about one's mother! Best wishes with yours!

I just put in a seven-hour day re-creating my mother's life as the respectable, responsible taxpayer the US government believes her to be. Against all odds, she has lost the pile of 1099s she's been collecting since the end of January.  
  
We had to cancel her appointment with her accountant after I ransacked her entire apartment and came up utterly 1099-less, dooming me to a long afternoon of calling 1-800 numbers and rattling off my mother's mother's maiden name.  
  
If it were not for the plethora of ephemera we produced during our search-and-rescue mission, the day might have been dismal.  
  
But in her underwear drawer, we found her marriage certificate from St. Catherine's Church and three photos of the girl my father was in love with before he married my mother in 1950.  
  
We found the cardboard boarding pass assigned to my father when he emigrated by boat from Scotland in 1946, something I'd never seen in all my life.  
  
We found the letter my mother wrote on behalf of her fiance to the Halls brothers (of Hallmark Cards fame), imploring them to take a look at the enclosed poems highly suited to be greeting card copy, penned by a man whose talent she believed in with all her heart. (She never heard back from the Halls.)  
  
We found a beautiful picture of my Aunt Cathie, circa 1944, which she had taken at the Emery, Bird, Thayer department store in downtown Kansas City soon after she came to this country. She'd inscribed it to her brother, my father, and sent it to him where he was stationed in the British army. "To Dev," she wrote, a shortened version of his Scottish hoodlum gang nickname, Devilero. (I come from interesting stock.)  
  
Holy cards from my brother's funeral, who died at age four, and my father's, and my grandparents'. Newspaper clippings and death certificates and citizenship papers and even a love letter or two.  
  
The only item that managed to comfort my rattled mother over the loss of her tax documents, though, was the timeworn, vintage magazine photo of Burt Reynolds, naked.  
  
Mama, Mama, Mama!
