Every time I come across this quote from the wildly prolific Isaac Asimov, I get a kick out of it all over again:  
  
"Whenever I have endured or accomplished some difficult task--such as watching television, going out socially, or sleeping--I always look forward to rewarding myself with the small pleasure of getting back to my typewriter and writing something. This enables me to store up enough strength to endure the next interruption."
