Novelist T.C. Boyle says this about writing:  
  
"First you have nothing, and then, astonishingly, after ripping out your brain and your heart and betraying your friends and ex-lovers and dreaming like a zombie over the page till you can't see or hear or smell or taste, you have something."  
  
Some days, I look at what I've got and think it's still nothing. But then I remember author Jean Auel, who said she'd writtten over a million words towards what would become "Clan of the Cave Bear," but still didn't have a story.  
  
Then I remember what author and humorist Liz Curtis Higgs says. "I can talk two hours without a subject." What if I can write eight months without a theme?  
  
So. I don't exactly have *nothing*. Of course, it remains to be seen if I have something more than 80,000 words that just happen to have never been put together in this precise order before.  
  
Oh, well. Back to ripping and betraying...
