      My sister and I comment to each other, my daughter and I comment to each other, my mother and I comment to each other (although to a lesser degree, as she is such a loving Christian lady that I still aspire, at middle age, to "grow up" to be just like her), but it astounds me sometimes the comments perfect (?) strangers will make in public.  
      Way to go on the bags, Katy! I've never been a creative wrapper. Just yesterday I threatened to bring the gifts down one at a time on Christmas morning as I got them (finally!) wrapped.

      Oh, all's fair among family and friends! But with strangers, unless the purchaser brings up the subject (maybe poking fun at herself), it shouldn't happen.  
        
      That said, the woman in front of me at WalMart last night did something I'd never do. While the young girl was quietly (politely!) checking the items, the customer said, "Guess what I'm making for dinner?" The girl said, "Uh, tacos?" "You guessed it!" So, the nuttiness works both ways, I'm thinking.  
        
      Merry Christmas, Anne!

The older I get, the more stuff I don't have time for.  
  
I started realizing this a number of Christmases ago, when Doug and I shopped to replace our 1980s fake Christmas tree. I'd already started blogging back then, something I've decided I definitely DO have time for. I wrote about our choice of trees, and our reasons, [here](http://www.fallible.com/2001_01_01_archive.html#2179688).  
  
This Christmas, something new has been added to my list of stuff I don't have enough good years left to pursue. I had no way of anticipating that this item was about to be added, until I headed upstairs to the "wrapping room" (AKA: Kevin's old room, the guest room, the bed and breakfast, and the Irish-whistle-playing room where Doug plays when Katy has a migraine).  
  
On my way up, I paid particular attention to the radiating pain in my lower back, which appears mysteriously when I even contemplate hunching over a bunch of presents on the floor and cutting wrapping paper to size. In addition, my neck, which is the sad bearer of not one but two herniated discs, called attention to the fact that I had slept so soundly, it had developed a crick.  
  
Or a cric, or a crik. A hitch in my git-along. Whatever.  
  
By the time I reached the wrapping room and took in the sight of the slung-around tissue sheets and rolls of paper, the several dispensers of Scotch tape, and the horde of oddly sized and shaped unwrapped gifts that would take eons to wrap, I was sorely tempted to scream. And possibly even run from the room--with scissors.  
  
Instead, I calmly walked back down the stairs, picked up my keys and purse, and headed to Dealz.  
  
Dealz is a dollar store, and they boast an entire wall of gift bags. Now, you should know that since the whole concept of gift bags arrived on the scene (which, for you younger readers, really wasn't all that long ago), I have resisted the urge to go there. On principle, you understand. They were just too darned expensive, sometimes nearly as costly as the gift I needed to wrap. But dollar stores have changed all that.  
  
I don't mind telling you flat out that I spent upwards of $45 (OK. You got me. Exactly $45) on precisely 45 gift bags. Bags that were marked with retail prices of up to $5 each, with such exhorbitant retail prices being the precise reason I have avoided the wholesale use of gift bags until now.  
  
What shocked me was the comments that both customers and employees of the store felt compelled to offer. It used to be considered the height of rudeness to comment on another's purchases, but these days, all bets are off. During my brief episodes in retail sales, we were trained never to say anything like the following:  
  
"You shouldn't be giving that many presents. I stopped doing that years ago."  
  
"What do you need all those for? You're spending too much money."  
  
"Do you have something against wrapping paper?"  
  
"Did you leave any bags for the other customers?"  
  
"My goodness! How many people are you buying for?"  
  
"I wish I lived at YOUR house."  
  
I was relieved to be deaf in my right ear by the time I got up to the check-out lane. My disability was the only thing that prevented me from hearing the exchange the clerk had ABOUT MY PURCHASE with the customers in line behind me!  
  
When I arrived home, I hauled my bags upstairs for another stab at gift containment. An hour later, I emerged from the room victorious and jubilant. Those $1 bags turned a back, neck, and patience-straining event into a sublime, time-saving pleasure.  
  
Like I said, when you get on in years, you've got to make some hard choices, people! Next time I go to Dealz, though, I think I'll choose to wear an earplug in my left ear.
