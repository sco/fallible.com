We mothers have a primal urge:  
Protect, nourish, and warm,  
Those in our care, whether young or old.

And so we watch the leaden skies:  
Wait, anticipate the storm,  
Plot out our plans, safe from gathering cold.

We brave the winds though they be fierce:  
Face brute threats of harm,  
To serve the helpless sheep within our fold.

“Make cinnamon rolls!” a small one cries:  
A waif-like, fragile form,  
“And popcorn balls!” Her voice becomes more bold.

So mothers do what they have done:  
Maintain maternal charm,  
By making sure this tale’s forever told.
