Saturday, a couple of sibs and I met Scott and his cousin Josie at my mom's house, to make one last sweep through her belongings. A couple of truckloads ended up going to Goodwill, but even at this late stage of the game, we still unearthed some treasures. I found a music box I'd never seen before, wound it and held it up to my ear as the others watched. "It's beautiful," I proclaimed, "but it's broken." One of them snatched it out of my hand and they all burst out laughing. Being stone deaf in one ear has its drawbacks.
