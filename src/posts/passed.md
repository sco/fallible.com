We passed by Colonial Presbyterian Church in the near dark last night, and I saw the sign.  
  
"Can we afford it?" I almost asked Doug. I'd already checked into it. $35 per month, for two mornings a week. We'd really have to stretch to make it work, but it was worth it, right?  
  
"Pre-school Now Enrolling," the sign said, and little Scotty spoke up from the back seat of the Datsun B210, or did he?  
  
"I'm going to go all by myself." The three-year-old's face beams with excitement.  
  
When I ask him now, he barely remembers the first teachers who shared my joy in showing him the world. He only vaguely recollects the Christmas pageants, and the singing, and the drawing, and the reading.  
  
He learned everything that they--and I--had to teach him, and moved on.  
  
"I think I'm going to go all over China for a few weeks by myself." I look up at the little boy in front of me, who beams with excitement.  
  
He's no baby. He's twenty-four.  
  
We passed by his little school in the near dark last night, and I saw the sign. "Pre-school Now Enrolling."  
  
Someday, I'll learn to read between the lines.
