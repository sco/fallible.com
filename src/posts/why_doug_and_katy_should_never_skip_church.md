We've had such an entertainment-intensive weekend at the Kansas City Irish Fest that we end up sleeping in this morning, and missing church.  
  
So we're in bed, drinking coffee, watching Fox News coverage of hurricane Frances. Since we're playing hookie, we briefly discuss assuaging our guilt by making a contribution to the Red Cross or the Salvation Army.  
  
It doesn't seem like enough, somehow.  
  
Then a Coast Guard officer appears to speak about a rescue they've made in the waters off Florida, and we are drawn even deeper into the plight of those in the storm's path.  
  
"How would you like to be called a *Rear Admiral*?" Doug asks.  
  
I look at him, pondering his somber eyes until I've encountered the very depths of his soul. I can think of no answer profound enough to offer. He sees that I am speechless, so he completes the thought himself.  
  
"*Your* rear's admiral-able."  
  
We'd better write a *couple* of checks.
