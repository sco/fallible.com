Our trash gets picked up on Monday mornings, early. Really. Really. *Early*.  
   
We need to invest in some heavy-duty metal trashcans because where we live, there are critters. The kind of critters who succeed in eating their weight in plastic trashcans the first time you put them out. We keep pricing the metal ones when we're in Wal-Mart or Home Depot and in ten years of comparison shopping, they keep getting more expensive.  
   
We're too cheap for our own good.  
   
  
Instead of springing for decent trashcans, which would allow us to put our trash out on Sunday night without regard for the antics of squirrel, possum, skunk, fox, deer, coyote, and crow, we stick post-its on our alarm clocks. We remind our self-employed selves (who have no where to go on Monday morning, and like it that way) that the alarm must be set for some ungodly pre-dawn  hour, so that Doug can load up the car and haul trash down to the end of our long driveway.  
   
Sometimes we forget the post-it note, and neglect to set the clock. Sometimes, though, because God's mercies are new every day, it isn't too late. This morning I bolted upright just moments after the truck most likely finished making its roll down our road.  
   
"Doug! The trash!"  
   
He sprang from the bed and was gone. He was back in only minutes, too soon, I thought, for him to have met with success. I expected him to groan and say, "They were long gone. I missed it--again."  
   
Instead, he came in gasping and said, "I caught up with them a couple of roads over. They almost got away, seemed like they even sped up a little as I rounded the corner. I wasn't sure they were going to wait for me. That one guy on the truck--he's been picking up our trash forever--he's just the happiest guy I've ever seen. Always has this huge smile on his face..."  
   
  
The guy must be a Christian, I thought. That would explain his early-morning joie-de-vivre, and even his obvious satisfaction with a job most of us would find thoroughly disgusting.  
   
Or maybe he just sees Doug coming and his cup of mirth runneth over.
