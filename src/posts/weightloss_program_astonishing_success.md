    text: "Katy, I didn't find the \"200 lb. in a weekend\" book in the 'burg, but I did get an earlier version of his called \"For Packrats Only.\" I'm assuming from reading it today that it is very similar to the one that you're reading. I don't know if I can do it to the extreme that you are, but I am starting to get motivated. As for the exercise equipment, THAT was tossed out years ago... :) lol"

    text: "Okay...my loss update...I cleaned out my bedroom closet and drawers. I have three overstuffed trash bags of clothes ready to donate to Big Brothers/Big Sisters. I also cleaned out the cabinet over the stove..you know the one..with all the cleaner supplies, bug sprays, and all the extra stuff you don't know where to put someplace else. I dumped about half of that cabinet in the trash. Since I can't lift heavy things, I don't know about my weight loss for the weekend, but I know that it certainly is a start, and it feels so darn good! :)"

Update on the weightloss front:  
  
Last weekend, we hauled 200 pounds of donated (not overdue!) books to the library.  
In addition, we hauled approximately 260 pounds of pure trash to the street. I also have 250 pounds of food to give to Harvesters. And perhaps 150 pounds (so far) of clothing to be repurposed at the local thift store, along with another 140 pounds of assorted knick-knacks and paddy-whacks.  
  
I've only begun to scratch the surface, folks. And I've lightened our load by a good half ton. How's *that* for quick weight loss?  
  
Now if I could just ditch some of this old exercise equipment, I'd be in even *better* shape...
