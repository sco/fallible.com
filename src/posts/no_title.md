      How 'bout Bathsheba's Roof? Or maybe that would be sending the wrong message entirely...

The trend for new churches these days seems to be quite possessive, at least as far as their names go. Here in Kansas City, we are home to Jacob's Well, Solomon's Porch, and Beggar's Table. Is it just me, or is it becoming difficult not to picture houses of worship called Dog's Crumbs, Abraham's Bosom, and Baptist's Locusts? Hey, I know: Shulamite's Pomegranites. If you have better ideas--or weirder--submit them here. You will be providing a needed service to Church Namers everywhere. Better yet, maybe one of you enterprising programmer types (Sco?) could create a Church Name Generator. The idea is all yours for the cost of a nice link to fallible.
