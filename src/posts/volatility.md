      I stayed home all day Wednesday, waiting for delivery of computers. Doorbell is broken, and I don't hear knocking very well. Couldn't talk on the phone, because that pretty much occupies my hearing ear. Couldn't do the dishes, because running water precludes me hearing the knock. At end of day, Doug called Office Depot. "Oh, we don't have those in stock. It's gonna be another week." It's already been 10 days since we ordered! Now I've got to cook all over again for Douglas! OK. Rant over.

Those of you who know my husband may think he's perfect, and you'd be nearly correct. Like the old ads for Ivory Soap, he's pure (of heart, mind, and body) about 99 44/100 percent of the time.  
  
That's a lot of goodness, people.  
  
Don't get me wrong. He slips up occasionally, but he knows that when he does, it will stay between the two of us. Last night he got furious about some little thing, something that wouldn't even register a blip on my ferocity radar screen.  
  
I know, I know. He's been under a tremendous amount of stress lately. I should cut him some slack, right? But I've got to think you'd be as shocked as I was to hear your dearly beloved say "Crap!" for only the second time in 27 years.  
  
I've got to tell you: I'm frightened. Tomorrow, my brand new computer is being delivered. It's been months--or is it years?--since I've enjoyed the reliability of a dependable computer, much less a functional printer.  
  
In fact, for the past month or so, my entire computing experience has been reduced to emails and pop-ups asking, "Katy, wouldn't you love to have a bigger BLEEP?"  
  
No, can't say that I would.  
  
Anyway, it falls to techie Doug to successfully transfer all salient files to my new computer, and I just don't know if he's emotionally up to the task right now. After the jolt of Crap! last night, who knows what crusty language may spew forth in the valiant attempt at file-transfer? (Talk about *corrupted files*...)  
  
I'm taking no chances. I'm writing books now, and my work is too important to me to lose any of it. So, until the new computer is successfully set up, Doug's going to get the royal treatment--anything to enhance his concentration and reduce his frustration.  
  
Ironed clothes, lattes to order, an organized office, and--in case he's been suffering from low blood sugar--plenty of good food. Especially good food.  
  
Hey, isn't there a sermon called "Dinner in the Hands of a Hungry Doug"?
