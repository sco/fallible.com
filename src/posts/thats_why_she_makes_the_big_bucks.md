      That's priceless... I hope he's not paying too much. I love that particular Starbucks for great overheard conversations... Oh, and the Panera on the Plaza is a goo one too.

      Steph, Yeah. The feminists have missed a bet, I'm thinking.... ;)  
        
      Amber, The HS is the only kind of change manager I can tolerate. Your pastor sounds like fun!

Very small, very loud talk overheard in Starbucks on the Plaza, between a woman I came to realize was something called a Change Management Consultant, and her male client, the owner of an insurance agency. I ask you, Does this man sound like someone who is *changing*, much less someone who wants to have his *change managed*?  
  
She: So, how have you *been*?  
He: Good.  
She: *Wow!* When did we *see* each other? After Thanksgiving?  
He: Yeah.  
She: So, things are going good? How have you been?  
He: Fine, good.  
She: Was Christmas good? How's your family?  
He: They're good.  
She: Wow, it's been so *long*. Was it before Thanksgiving? Was it Halloween? How have you *been*?  
He: Good, good.  
She: I'm glad you could make it.  
He: Yeah. Sorry I'm late. I feel bad.  
She: Oh, it's OK. But how have you *been*? Been busy?  
He: Yeah. Really busy. I would have called.  
She: So, what's been going on?  
He: Not too much. Not much. Nothing.  
She: You're feeling good? You look good.  
He: Yeah. Pretty good.  
She: Wow. So when did we last meet? It's been *too long*.  
He: Yeah.  
  
These are the types of overheard conversations that make me *so happy* I'm not a Change Management Consultant, or for that matter, a client.
