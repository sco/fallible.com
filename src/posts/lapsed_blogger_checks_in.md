      Happy New Year, Katy! It sounds like it may be a lovely and productive year for you.  
        
      And, by the way, there are only seven days in a week. Unless you and God have some sort of deal where you get the eighth day free (where can I sign up?).

      Seven days. You're right. Of course. All day today, I thought it was Friday, and was thrilled to find out this evening that tomorrow is Friday, giving me an entire day I hadn't counted on having for finishing my book!! Just like having eight days a week--I feel like a frickin' Beatle.  
        
      God's blessings on all your endeavors this year, Maria!

      Lisa, I have always thought, and still think, that moms with little kids are the true inspirations. If they take their job seriously, that is. You're my inspiration!  
        
      Bridgie, I feel it, all right. Now, with Doug's mom in hospital, things are even more complicated! How did you know what my b-day wish was? Tee, hee.  
        
      Amber, Girl! Write your book, and keep me informed about it. We blogging authors need to stick together.  
        
      Irene, Thanks. Dreams are funny, huh? I've never had one come true unless I worked my you-know-what off! But this project has been great fun--we'll see what happens.  
        
      Tim, Happy New Year to you and your lovely wife. My book--if published--will probably be billed as women's contemporary fiction, but there's a lot of guy stuff in it. It's all third person, but through the viewpoints of four main characters, two men and two women. Doug thinks I get inside the men's heads quite realistically. I've tried not to let his assessment worry me too much! So I hope you will like it, since it's not just about chicks.

It's been pointed out to me by my blogging little sister, Bridget, that I am not producing a quantity of blog entries consistent with my typical output. She is right, and I am sorry.  
  
I am, however, working approximately twelve hours per day, eight days a week, on completing my first novel. I hope to have the disk in the mail on January 19. If I am a spotty blogger between now and then, please forgive me.  
  
And make a few resolutions, on the off-chance that they will sink into your sub-conscious even if you lose the written copy, and affect your coming year in positive ways. It can't hurt, and it might help.  
  
Last week, I found my resolutions for 2003, and was surprised to find I'd actually succeeded in several points. I exercised diligently for at least eight months of the year, a record for me. And I established an inviolable writing schedule, which has resulted in me being hired to edit three novels for others, and to complete my own book--all in all, a banner year.  
  
A very Happy New Year to all my friends here at fallible.com. I treasure you more than you know.
