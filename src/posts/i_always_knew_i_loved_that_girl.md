      Thanks for the link.  
        
      That girl is almost as smart as you are.  
        
      Take Care

      Of course the recognition is nice, but this may be a difficult burden to bear on a post-by-post basis. Maybe following the Pope's example would be wise, informing the reader when you are in "infallible" mode. On these posts we would remove the comments feature since no further discussion is warranted.  
        
      Since we'll want to make that search engines are aware of this valuable resource, I'll edit the keywords metatag to include "perfect, foolproof, airtight, fail-safe, surefire, flawless, faultless, absolute, accurate, spot on, etc."

      Whoa...and her tech guy's infallible, too! :)  
        
      Michael--Welcome! I am just beginning to read your blog, and enjoying it. I love it that your wife made a picture album just for you. What I really love about it is that you wrote about it!

      I'm a big fan of LaShawn Barber's, too! I recently wrote that her blog is what I want my blog to be when it grows up. :)  
        
      I would actually be flattered if she put me on her blogroll, even if she got the name wrong. :)

I've thought very highly of fellow blogger LaShawn Barber since I discovered her site six months or so ago. If you haven't checked her out yet at [http://www.lashawnbarber.com](http://www.fallible.com/index.php?URL=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.lashawnbarber.com) , you should. She's brilliant, bold, and blessed with a good heart and a strong mind.  
  
And maybe even an overactive imagination.  
  
We had reason to correspond by email a couple of times this past weekend. She wanted to link to fallible in a post of hers, and was dismayed to find that her new blogroll didn't inlcude my site. (I had not noticed that fallible wasn't there, but she had.) She used to have fallible on her roll, and within minutes of her sending me the email, there it was again.  
  
Today, I was scanning her blogroll and found the source of her supposed oversight. When you get down to the letter "i" in her alphabetical list, there I am.  
  
LaShawn Barber is my new best friend! She'd be yours, too, if she called you "infallible."
