      as an Evangelical Christian, i don't know if i'm ready for The Passion. i have tickets to see it this sunday, but i have a feeling it will be the most difficult thing i will ever encounter - not only His suffering, but my complete inadequacy to reciprocate such a vast love.

I commented here a few days ago at my first visit and have since read through all your archives. I adore your blog and your writing! Hope it's okay that I added you to my list of blogs I read. :) (By the way, my blog has moved since I first commented. I'm now at the new URL listed)."

      Jenn, I've given up my hope of "readiness." It's kind of like trying to be good enough to deserve redemption. It's not gonna happen. Still can't bring myself to see it, though.  
        
      Carrie, You know how I am with violence. Low tolerance, to say the least. Do you think I should try to see this?  
        
      Kristine, I'm glad you're here! And that you've enjoyed the archives. I really like your blog--it's so welcoming to look at, and well-written. I'll keep checking in!  
        
      Lisa, Yes. Waiting is OK. Never seeing it is fine, too. A few trusted friends have said that they actually became numb to the violence after a while, and felt less emotionally moved than they anticipated. Strange, huh?

The Passion of the Christ opens today, and I will see it. Soon. Really.  
  
Being raised a Catholic, I am not unaccustomed to the more visual aspects of Jesus' sacrifice. I grew up in a church where the tomb may have been empty, but the cross wasn't. When the priest held up the eucharistic host and the chalice of wine and prayed for the elements to become the body and blood of Christ, one couldn't help but be moved by the stark reminder of Jesus' death. The image of his broken body hung on the cross behind the altar, a potent backdrop for the priest's upraised arms.  
  
It's been said that the people who will be most shocked by Mel Gibson's film are evangelical Protestants, and I wonder if there isn't some truth to that. I read a review by a Christian singer based in Nashville who said, essentially, that until she saw this movie, it had never occurred to her that Jesus had actually felt pain during the crucifixion. Her understanding had been that, because Jesus was God, he couldn't actually feel physical pain--that He was somehow above that type of lowly experience.  
  
It's estimated that approximately 250,000 Jews were crucified under the Romans, and it's plainly obvious that all of them experienced excruciating agony. With the exception of the crown of thorns, which was added to Jesus' torture as a form of mockery because He did not deny that He was indeed the King of the Jews, there is nothing in the Scriptures to indicate that his physical death was much different than anyone else's who died by crucifixion.  
  
But I believe His experience was terribly, horribly, wonderfully different, that the extent of His suffering was indeed beyond what any man has ever suffered. I believe God's Son has a capacity for suffering that is as far beyond ours as is His capacity for love, because both the suffering and the love are completely selfless.  
  
I am ready now, almost ready, to see The Passion of the Christ. Soon. Really.
