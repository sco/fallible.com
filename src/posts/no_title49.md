      thanks for the reply katy,<br>the service went well yesterday<br>despite some tension over an <br>estranged grand-daughter who'd<br>stolen from and swindled this dear old<br>lady. she wept the most... was it <br>remorse or repentence or something<br>much less? God only knows, but the <br>seed of the gospel was scattered <br>and perhaps ... perhaps those tears<br>will moisten a parched soul and the <br>Spirit may germinate new life in the <br>passing of the old.

My new email friend [Pastor Dave](http://alamedacrc.com/) says that no matter how many funerals he conducts, the one thing he wishes is that he'd known the deceased better. He's in good company. I've sat through services where the minister kept calling the dearly departed by the wrong first name. And not just a little bit wrong, either. Not just "Bill" when it should have been "Bob." That kind of mistake causes the congregants to merely snicker, proud of themselves for being intimate friends with Bob. No, I'm talking "Horatio" when it should have been "Malcolm"--the kind of error that reduces a roomful of mourners into a puddling mass of hysterics. If the truth be known, of course, most of the gigglers and weepers don't know Malcolm very well, either. If the deceased had only been known better by the minister, we think, there would be an air of authenticity about the event that would comfort us--almost as if we'd taken the time to know the fellow ourselves. We could nod, and smile through tears, and feel more heartbroken than we are, thankful that the minister did his job and reached out while the poor guy was still alive. Attending a funeral gives me pause to examine what's true about my relationships, and to change what's false. Sometimes, I think, it's even better if the minister doesn't know the deceased at all. If I knew him, really knew him, it should be enough. And if I didn't, well, the minister's friendship with him might turn out to be an undeserved comfort. Maybe it's better if I have to squirm a little.
