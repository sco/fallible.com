      Oooh cool stuff. I love your writing, Katy - I always look forward to your updates. I tell myself, "If I could just write like her - or like the Real Live Preacher..." But then I wouldn't be me. (Which might not be such a bad thing sometimes, but, well!) hehe

By the time you're thirty, at the rate you're going, you will have a lot of writing under your belt--all of it better than when you were younger! (It's great right now, but you know what I mean...don't waste your youth not writing!)<br><br>Jonah--Yes. Lennon might have meant your choice number two, which \"feels\" a little better than number one, but not enough to sing about! Tee, hee. It would be lovely not to fight about God, heaven, etc., but if we had to eliminate truth to get to that point, well. Hmmm. Hey, thanks for commenting here!<br>"

I long to be in Your presence. <br><br>thanks for that word of encouragement."

I'm as big a Beatles fan as anyone, but the song *Imagine* has always bugged me. It's the premise that does me in every time I hear it, from back in the day until now.  
  
"Imagine there's no heaven. It's easy if you try..."  
  
For all these years, I've worried that I must have no imagination whatsoever, or at least no powers of concentration, because I couldn't make this work for me. I couldn't imagine heaven away.  
  
Mercy Me's song, *I Can Only Imagine*, is the perfect antidote to the old standby, and the world must have been ready for it. It's climbing to the top of even secular charts.  
  
The scripture makes it clear that none of us can even begin to imagine all the wonderful things God has prepared for those who love Him. Our tiny minds won't stretch that far.  
  
But when my heart goes on a flight of fancy, this is what it sings:  
  
"Surrounded by your glory, What will my heart feel?  
Will I dance for you, Jesus? Or in awe of you be still?  
Will I stand in your presence? To my knees will I fall?  
Will I sing halleujah? Will I be able to speak at all?  
I can only imagine."  
  
I can only imagine.
