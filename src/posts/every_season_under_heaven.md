      it was lovely, katy...kudos on the spinning in that space.  
        
      i'm in the midst, the very thick of raising children - and though their needs and stuff and noise and questions fill every crevice of my life to capacity and beyond, still i can see a bit down the road, through the eyes of friends whose children are older, even grown and gone, that this time is fleeting, and every day quickly becomes a memory that travels further backward down the line. God give us grace to live in the now...

      Katy,  
      I was recently introduced to your blog by my sister, Anne. I'm hooked! Your post here about every season under heaven was particularly sweet to me. My children are still quite young (2 and 4) and while I can't wait for the 2-year old to stop screaming, I'm practically tearing up for a good cry knowing my 4-year old will head out to preschool in 2 weeks. All of it reminds me of why I have always loved living in a part of the country with all 4 seasons. The urgency I feel to really start enjoying one season before it's gone and then the anticipation of the looming season -- I don't think I could really live any other way. I guess this is how it will be with my children, too. Thanks for all your great life insights!

"Can you believe something so beautiful was created in one night?"  
  
My lifelong friend, Amy, sat drinking coffee with me at my kitchen table. We stared in awe through the patio door, at the enormous spider web which began on the roofline and extended to the edge of the picnic table ten feet away.  
  
If we'd put a song on the stereo right about then, I'm thinking it would have been the Byrds singing "Turn, Turn, Turn." You know, to everything there is a season.  
  
On Saturday, it was the season to marry off our first-born child.  
  
"How do spiders do it?" we asked each other. "And why? It seems like the webs are never there very long. They put all that work into it and then..."  
  
I looked at the clock. "Grab a muffin, girlfriend. It's time to build."  
  
We hustled into her car, heading for the Arts Incubator in downtown Kansas City, where Scott and Brooke would be holding their reception later that night. On our way down the road, the sunshine broke through the foggy dew just enough to reveal dozens of webs like the one in my backyard, all so gorgeous and intricate and amazing that Amy stopped the car several times to snap pictures of them.  
  
By the time we arrived at the gallery at ten, the hands of a dozen friends and family members of the bride and groom were hard at work. Some assembled trays of homemade cookies, others arranged tables with cloths and candles, still others filled metal tubs with an assortment of water bottles and Coke cans--each one weaving a piece of a marvelous web.  
  
By two o'clock, the work was done. We had turned the space into a wonderful venue for the party our children had envisioned.  
  
The bride's parents exchanged looks with us, and smiled through veiled tears. We knew all too well that less than twelve hours later, we'd be tearing down everything we'd built.  
  
Amy and I headed back to the house to get dressed for the wedding. As we drove up the final stretch of road, I saw her reach for her camera again. She slowed the car in front of the two trees along my driveway where just hours ago a perfect web had been spun between them.  
  
"Just like *that*," I snapped my fingers, "they're gone..."  
  
She groaned, and we both knew we weren't talking about spiders any more.  
  
A time to build, a time to tear down.  
  
A time to hold on, a time to let go.  
  
"Can you *believe*," she said, "something so beautiful will be created again tonight?"  
  
A time to love.
