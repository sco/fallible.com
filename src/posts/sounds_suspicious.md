There's a radio show here that's been on the air for what seems like forever, called "Kansas City's Moneyline." It's a call-in show, and the host, an amiable accountant named Peter Newman, uses the tagline, "We're here to take *all* your money questions."  
  
Last Saturday, Peter was on vacation, and several men were filling in for him, trying to give the show the same personality it would have if the host was there.  
  
After the top of the hour news, the fill-in guy came back to the microphone and said, "Welcome to Kansas City's Moneyline. We're here to take *all* your money."  
  
So *that's* what happened.
