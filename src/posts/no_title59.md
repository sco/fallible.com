      Yep...Jim felt the same way about my spoon rest. And the cookie jar. And the wooden note-holder. And the egg poacher. And... :)

My husband is a patient man. Really, he is. He's restrained himself as I've hauled home treasures these past couple of months, the keepsakes of my mother's estate. Sometimes, he's even done the heavy lifting. A house divided cannot stand, they say. But my mother's house has been divided six ways and then some. She moved her most essential furnishings into her new small apartment, and the rest has fallen into the hands of her five children and fourteen grandchildren. And still we--her family--remain undivided. I've been unpacking the boxes slowly, more for his sake than for mine. How many alligator handbags from the 30s and 40s should one man have to endure all in one shot? And what's he going to think when he sees the circa 1950 Mixmaster and the unwieldly crates of embroidered pillowcases? A woman can take sentiment too far. Just now he wandered into the kitchen, where the landscape changes hourly as fond possessions trickle up from my stash in the basement. "Do you like my spoon rest?" I ask, as I fondle the ceramic montrosity. It was my mother's, and her mother's before her. He should feel honored. "Well, I wouldn't want it sitting out all the *time*," he answers, in the tone of a diplomatic hopeful. "Honey," I say, "if you wouldn't want a spoon rest sitting out all the time, you wouldn't want it sitting out at *all*...right?" I stir the pot of beans, plop the syruppy spoon on the spoon rest, and look up at him, satisfied. "Uh...I love it," he says. And I can just hear my father saying the very same thing.
