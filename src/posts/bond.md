"Guess what movie's on cable tonight?" I asked my daughter, Carrie.  
  
She had said it was chick flick night at her apartment, and the girls were trying to choose among several selections.  
  
Carrie probably thought I was going to refer her to "Sense and Sensibility" or "Little Women" or "Pride and Prejudice" or "Anne of Green Gables." It would be just like me.  
  
But there's our relationship to consider. We've established a closeness you just can't arrive at with the classics. When I told her my pick, she was genuinely touched and said, "Mom, I love it that you love that movie, too. It's so nice to have that to share with you."  
  
A couple of tender moments passed before we said our abrupt good-byes.  
  
Neither of us wanted to miss the opening of "Romy and Michelle's High School Reunion."
