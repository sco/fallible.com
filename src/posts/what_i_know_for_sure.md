      Not to downplay what happened on Oprah's show, but I read a report that she actually didn't pay for the vehicles. GM paid for everything. She may have had something to do with convincing them to donate the cars which is great, but if that's the case it isn't like she forked over a large sum of her cash to do it.  
        
      Nonetheless Oprah is an interesting and warm character. The things she has done in Africa out of her own pocket have been amazing. Props to her.

      Kevin, You're right. I used the words "gives away" incorrectly. I should have said, "distributes," because the car maker made the actual donation.  
        
      And yes, her personal reach into Africa has been substantial, from what I understand. And life changing for her, from what she says. She and Bono are making a real difference there.

      I watched a special on ABC over the summer, if I remember correctly, with my girlfriend. It was incredible all the resources that were poured into various areas, and she was there every step of the way talking to children and women (again, if I remember correctly). Amazing.  
        
      BTW I was introduced to your site via Tim Samoff, and have really enjoyed randomly going through your old entries. Keep up the great writing :).

      Jesus Loves Me, This I Know (for sure)  
      Light drives away darkness.  
      Faith conquers fear.  
      Hope is stronger than despair.

      Four things:  
      1\. There is a God  
      2\. He loves me  
      3\. He has something specific for me to do  
      4\. He wants me to be like Him  
        
      Frankly, I find myself wavering from time to time on any of these. But I have made up my mind that no matter what my emotions tell me, I will not give any of them up  
        
      The lead editorial in Scientific American a month or two ago told about a guy who had come up with a way to figure the odds on whether there is a God or not. It was based on factors like education, personal religous experiences, witnessing a miracle, etc. He gave God a 67% chance of existing. The writer of the editorial put it at 2%.  
        
      When I think about it (as I am doing now) I have to out it at 100%. For all four of my beliefs. There is no doubt.

The back page of Oprah's magazine bears this permanent title, and underneath it appears a monthly article of at least a thousand words written by Oprah herself.  
  
Every time I turn to the back, I'm struck again by the audacious words. It's a title few of us would dare ascribe to our own writings or thoughts, since contained in its simple five syllables are two words which have fallen out of fashion: *Know* and *sure*.  
  
The way I see it, Oprah has earned the right to know at least one thing per month for sure. (Anybody who gives away a brand new Pontiac to every member of her studio audience like she did on yesterday's show has earned a lot of rights!)  
  
But what about the rest of us? Do we believe so absolutely in a dearth of absolutes that we wouldn't personally claim to know a single thing *for sure*?  
  
How about you? Is there anything you'd be counted for? Anything at all about which you'd say, "*This is what I know for sure*"?
