    text: "kari, I can't claim the suspicious mole. I'm sure Anne said it first. Phooey!<br><br>Lisa, Yes. Corpses don't bother me nearly as much as they used to! Hey, I finally got the documentary on Lamott, and loved it. OK, I'll admit I didn't love the part where Anne performs a wedding for the two gay guys, I admit it. (Maybe I'm just old.) Also got a 2-audio set from a writer's conference. Lots restated from Bird by Bird, but still wonderful."

    text: "i know katy...though i had many, many close gay friends in my b.c. days of chicago theatre/clubbing...i just can't quite put the two and two together of it these days, and that part bothered me a bit. not because i'm afraid of gay people, but because i don't believe they're living in the peace that only christ can give. and yes, a lot of anne ideas get restated...but i'm loyal, and they're great nontheless :)"

I used to think it was the low-carb diet that shifted my metabolism into the most efficient fat-burning mode of my life. I gave Dr. Atkins (may he rest in peace) the credit for my sixty-pound loss, and for the renewed vigor that gave me the strength to commit to the writing life.  
  
Now I see the writing came first, and then the weight loss. And that the loss may not have come from a sugar-free lifestyle at all, but rather from a-hopefully-curable ailment called Lamott's Syndrome.  
  
Named for its neurotic founder, writer Anne Lamott, Lamott's Syndrome is a condition which manifests itself in the aerobic activity of getting up and down from one's chair after the writing of every two words, give or take a couple.  
  
It involves obsessive sink scouring, stain pre-treating, junk drawer organizing, suspicious-mole checking, and any other avoidance behavior known to writerkind, along with whatever self-bribery it takes to get back to the desk after these energetic spurts of non-writing.  
  
And don't underestimate the calorie-burning capacity of the accompanying guilt, self-doubt, self-flaggellation, and beating oneself up coming and going. Believe me, it adds up.  
  
I'll stick with the diet for sure. If I happen to put on a few pounds, though, you'll know it's because I finally succeeded in giving up the exercise.
