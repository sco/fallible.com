The dream lasted only seconds and consisted of a single scene. A radiant bride, in a gown with a train ten feet long, appeared in the back of the cathedral for her long walk down the aisle. As she took her first steps, the hem of her train caught on fire. With each step, the fire grew, until it was gaining on the bride. Still, she kept moving forward. Every invited guest fled. Every attendant backed away toward the exits, solemn witnesses of an event they could not have imagined. But the bride would not be deterred. At the end of it all, she stood in front of the altar, her face still beaming, her dress in flames, and waited alone for her bridegroom.
