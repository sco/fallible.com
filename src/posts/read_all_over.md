We've been working on my 81-year-old mother-in-law's house, room by room. She lives alone, and the house has gotten the best of her now, with its 33-year accumulation of Reader's Digests, National Geographics, and Price Chopper ads.  
  
You read that right.  
  
She's collected a lot of Christian books over the years, many on the subjects of faith and miracles and prayer and allowing Christ to change your life. She's still a strong believer--maybe stronger than ever--but she doesn't read much anymore.  
  
One by one, I held up books for her to decide on: Keep, sell, or give away? She doesn't plan to fast, so that book could go. Larry Burkett's book on retirement planning would have been better applied 25 years ago, so forget it. And the marriage manuals were past their prime.  
  
*How about this one?* I asked, as we neared the last of the pile. *Would you like to keep it?*  
  
She read the title under her breath, looked me in the eye and--with a straight face--said, "It's getting a little late to change my destiny."  
  
She's still got it.
