Seventeen-year-old Kevin and I are having a baking day. I'm baking my every-so-often ten loaves of honey whole wheat bread. He's looking forward to a fund-raising bake sale at church this Sunday, and tackling an untested recipe for Hershey Kiss cookies. He followed the instructions to the letter, blending the correct amounts of flour, sugar, butter, vanilla, and eggs. The dough then needed to be refrigerated for one hour before wrapping it around the kisses. I kept up with my mixing, kneading, rising, baking and wondering where Kev had disappeared to. His bowl of cooky dough still sat on the table, no closer to being ready to be shaped into delectibles than it had been ages ago. Finally, I called down to the basement, because I swear I heard him playing pool. "Kev, didn't you mean to put this dough into the fridge?" "No," he answered, with a cue in his hand and the confidence of a guy who can read plain English. "The directions say to chill for one hour." A domestic god in the making.
