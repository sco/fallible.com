"I haven't dreamed of your dad more than three times in the eighteen years since he died," my mother says. "And I never dream of my parents. I wish I could dream of all of them more often..." Wow, Mom. I dream of Dad at least once every two weeks, and of my grandparents (who died in the 1970s) once a month. And, for good measure, Mom herself has a feature role every week. No one can accuse me of not staying in touch.
