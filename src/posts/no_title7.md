Our 23-year-old son Scott has a pesky problem pertaining to unpaid personal property tax and an expired license plate on his car. Apparently, Missouri doesn't have it on record that he owns the car, which we purchased for him as a graduation present in June, 2001. Scott didn't cause the mess, but he'll get to untangle it. Still, being the compassionate mother and red-tape-savvy taxpayer that I am, I want to give him a few pointers. So I ask my husband to help me with the details. "Which summer was it that we bought the car?" I ask. "Wasn't it 2001?" The year is critical, as it determines how much back tax Scott will have to fork over. "What year did he graduate from college?" Doug asks. "Because that's when we bought the car." "I *know* that," I say. "*Help* me here." "Well, let's see," Doug says, and the wheels start to turn. "I think he graduated from high school in 2000..." (and I'm thinking, *no, silly, that was Carrie*) "and so he must have graduated from college in 2004." 2002, a spaced odyssey.
