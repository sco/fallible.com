      That comment rubbed me the wrong way too. And believe me, I'm really in a twist over this election. On the one hand, my conscience simply won't allow me to vote for a man who consistently votes a pro-choice line, and on the other hand, my freedom is totally at stake with guys like John Ashcroft off the leash. What's a girl to do? For the first time in my life, I don't think I can vote in good conscience for either candidate. Of course, even if I can't, I'll still show up and vote for the locals.

      "In good conscience" is a phrase we don't hear much anymore. Our pastor taught about conscience last week, taking me back to my Catholic upbringing, back to the days when kids were taught to end every day with an "examination of conscience."  
        
      I've cast a few votes for President that I regretted later (hey, I'm fifty, it happens!), but so far I've always been able to vote with a good conscience. If I couldn't, I would not vote.  
        
      I'm a Missouri girl, so we "knew" John Ashcroft back in the day. Unless I'm completely mistaken, he was well-respected here before being put in the position he's in now. I don't envy his job, and I do share some misgivings about our liberties being eroded. The whole freedom/security thing is difficult, isn't it?  
        
      Hey, which founding father was it who said something like (and boy is this a paraphrase!) "When people value security more than freedom, they deserve neither"? We certainly better think it through before we start giving up freedoms--where does it end?

      The fact is that the Democrats have not provided any solutions. They are feeding on our fears, saying they will get us out of Iraq, they will turn the enconomy around, will provide affordable health care, balance the budget. George W. Bush would do all of these if there was a way. How can the Democrats do it? If they have the answers why haven't they done it?  
      I don't know how much all of this matter anymore. I'll vote. We all should vote, but seems that events have taken on a life of their own. I think somewhere back down the road, maybe a hundred years ago, God kicked something into motion and whatever happens is meant to be.  
      I have never been a fan of Bible prophecy. People point to events that they say portend the return of Christ and I wonder. There have been catalismic events before. There have been diasters and dictators gone mad. There have been wars that seemed to ravage the world beyond society's ability to withstand. Yet we've survived.  
      But now it seems that events are rushing toward us that are beyond and leader's ability to control. I don't know what's going to happen next. All we can to is just hang on. And remember God is in control.

      "But it makes a much better side effect than a job description."  
        
      Methinks that is a line I will be quoting frequently - and with pride - for the next several weeks...brilliantly said.

      Angus, I'm hoping that when the candidates debate, Kerry will be more forthcoming about the specifics of his plans for the economy, for health care, etc. Hey, even I have a plan. And as long as I don't tell anyone what it is, they can go on imagining it's a GOOD one!  
        
      Jennifer, Quote away! Thanks for your kind words.

      Can any of you please tell me one liberty you've lost since John Ashcroft has been our AG? HEck, how about one piece of freedom your \_neighbour\_ has lost since Ashcroft's appointment?  
        
      And please don't just regurgitate some ACLU drivel that you've caught on your favourite rock station or from a Washington Post columnist...

"My fellow Americans: we are here tonight united in one simple purpose: to make America stronger at home..."  
  
With these words, John Kerry opened his speech accepting the nomination of the Democratic party for President of the United States.  
  
*Stronger at home* is easy to agree with. Is there a candidate anywhere who wouldn't commit to strengthening our economy, our education system, our families? Is there a candidate anywhere who wouldn't espouse his particular version of more affordable health care, fairer taxes, and safer streets?  
  
Even if the parties disagree in the particulars of how to make America stronger at home, we can all at least nod and yawn and be lulled into a familiar, comfortable sense of deja-vu when we hear the soothing words.  
  
Yes, John Kerry almost had me at *stronger at home*.  
  
But then he took a breath and hammered out the second plank of his platform: *"...and respected in the world."*  
  
That's it? That's the core value that will define the Democratic Party in this presidential election?  
  
It's hard not to think of Winston Churchill at a time like this. Hard not to picture him toughing it out, singular in his opposition to other, more powerful world leaders--including those in his own country--who would have continued forever in their policy of appeasement until the enemy was at their very own gate. And perhaps even afterward.  
  
It's hard to forget Churchill's nearly-ruined political reputation and the broken, wholly disregarded man he had become by the time public opinion began to shift in his noble direction.  
  
He had chosen a different value, a value which the rest of the world was slow to embrace, and one for which he garnered no respect, except in hindsight. He proposed standing against the gathering forces of evil, doing what he believed was right, though none go with him.  
  
My father fought with the British Army for eight years, stationed both in Egypt and in Sicily. I remember him saying how America's forces were more than a bit late to the party, how if it weren't for Churchill going it alone, the world might have been lost.  
  
*Respected in the world*? It's nice work if you can get it, I guess. But it makes a much better side effect than a job description.  
  
Not only that: it takes a whole lot of being willing to go without it before it starts to come your way.  
  
And unless you've earned it, why would you want it anyway?
