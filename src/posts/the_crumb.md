      The people I work for eat mammoth amounts of toast, and I too end up being the crumb cleaner. The worst of it is, though, that there are always toast crumbs in the butter. Yuck.

![Crumbs Against Humanity](http://www.fallible.com/img/thumbnails/toast.gif)OK, here's the deal.  
  
My husband's idea of a perfect snack is toast. Of course, he also eats toast for breakfast. And lunch and dinner are not without their toasted components, either.  
  
His is a toast-intensive regime and, more often than not, it is I, who eat no toast, who clean up all the crumbs.  
  
I'm not ready to demand a regime change. But I am emboldened enough to declare that this man should be stopped from committing his flagrant crumbs against humanity.
