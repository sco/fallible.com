We always put in the songs that the kids and I have been listening to in the van as we run errands. What a great way to see how varied our tastes are -- we have everything from Veggie Tales and Philadelphia Chickens to Steven Curtis Chapman, Josh Groban, Mercy Me, John Denver and Bette Midler's tribute to Rosemary Clooney! It is so fun to go back and compare and see how much our kids have grown and changed! I hope you have a wonderful celebration with your mom."

      Oh, what wonderful song picks, Katy!  
        
      A few years ago, my parents celebrated their 50th wedding anniversary, and I had a video put together of pics from their life. It just had a few songs on the soundtrack: "It Had to Be You" and "Our Love Is Here to Stay," both by Harry Connick Jr, and ending up with a "The Longer I Serve Him" medley by Mark Lowry (my dad was a pastor.)  
        
      Those old songs in particular are so wonderful, so evocative...do they write songs like that anymore???  
        
      By the way, since my dad passed away in July, I'm more glad than ever that I had that video made.

      You guys are so nice! I will convey your well wishes to my mother!  
        
      I must be an incorrigible sap, because yesterday I watched the movie with Doug for the first time, and GUSHED tears. Since I had brain surgery, my right eye rarely produces tears. I am a left-eye-only weeper. But yesterday even my right eye couldn't be held back!  
        
      I've often considered writing a "tribute" to my mom, based on the idea Dennis Rainey writes about, but this might be even better in its impact. The whole "a picture is worth 1000 words" thing...

Some of you will remember that in February, my 83-year-old mother-in-law, Adele, became a published book author.  
  
Lest you imagine that self-publishing meant any less to her than if Random House or Putnam or one of the University presses had picked up her volume of poetry, think again. The lady has been thrilled out of her mind with all the requests, at the retirement home where she lives, for autographed copies of her book. She called Doug about a week after her birthday, when she found herself with a few minutes to catch her breath between fans, and said she'd never been happier in her whole life.  
  
I gotta tell you, this made me feel so good I could hardly stand it.  
  
Well, next Sunday we celebrate my mother's 75th birthday. She hasn't written any unpublished works, unless you count all her endless, entertaining lists of every imaginable category, including her accidents, illnesses, and diseases along with dates of onset. She's a corker, my mom.  
  
What made me think that putting together an iMovie of her life would be a manageable project, I can't say for sure. Maybe I knew from the beginning that it would be difficult to gather pics from far and wide to try to recreate the story of an only child who married, had six children of her own, then a bunch of in-law kids and fourteen grandchildren, and finally four great-grandchildren. Okay, I knew getting everyone to catch my vision would be challenging, possibly even impossible--but still doable.  
  
So we did it. Carrie is an experienced iMovie producer. She came home from college for the weekend to put all the pieces together, around 250 scanned pics--a thirteen-minute-long show.  
  
Last night at midnight, when she was nearly finished, I dropped into bed and told Doug, "I'm so tired, I don't think I can even enjoy the movie. I sure hope Mom does, but I'm pooped."  
  
The show is set to five songs, in this order: Sentimental Journey by Barry Manilow; The Way You Look Tonight by Frank Sinatra; I'll Be Seeing You (In All the Old Familiar Places) by Bing Crosby; In My Life by Rod Stewart; and What A Wonderful World by Louis Armstrong. I didn't get a chance to watch the whole thing until just now, when Carrie and I sat down together and viewed it straight through twice in a row.  
  
If you ever want to get a different perspective (a visual and musical one) on the entire scope of your parent's life, or on your kooky family dynamics, or on whether or not there's anything to the whole birth order thing, put together one of these movies. I'm learning something new each time I watch it.  
  
I bawled my fool head off, just so you know. And laughed like a crazy lady. And I still can't wipe the nutty grin off my face.  
  
I hope Mom has a wonderful birthday. When I look back on her 75 years, I realize just how much she deserves it.
