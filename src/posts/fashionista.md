      My mom wears lots of scarves, and I love them! I've actually bought scarves for her before for various holidays.  
        
      I've even taking to wearing scarves myself these days. Of course, I wear them in a much more modern, Eurofabulous way. :)

When Carrie, the twenty-two-year old, and I plan to appear in public together, I try to coordinate what I'm wearing with what she puts on. My last inclination in the world would be to do anything that might embarass her refined fashion sensibilities.  
  
Yesterday she had a doctor's appointment and I planned to go with her. She put on jean shorts and a white sleeveless top. I followed her lead with jean capris and a blue t-shirt.  
  
But then I noticed my new silk scarf sitting on the dresser, the one I got at my favorite store in the world, Victorian Papers. It's long and narrow, and printed with a period montage of Spencerian script (love letters, all), fountain pens, cancelled stamps of ages past, and postmarks.  
  
I draped it around my neck and went to where she stood in front of my bathroom mirror. "Look at my scarf, Care. Isn't it *so me*?"  
  
"Um, *yeah*," she said. "It's you all right." I glanced into the mirror and saw the tinge of panic in her eyes. "But you're not going to *wear* it..."  
  
I began to loosely tie it in front, which only further accentuated the horror of the contrast between it and my well-worn t-shirt. "Sure I am," I said. "Don't you *love* it?"  
  
"I *do*," Carrie answered, which translated means *I don't*. "But, Mom, it just doesn't *go*..."  
  
I whipped the elegant accoutrement from my neck. "Just kidding!"  
  
Carrie's shoulders dropped a full six inches and the terror left her face. And then my daughter spoke the line I treasure most, the one I couldn't wait to hear her say.  
  
"Mom, don't do that! *You scared me*!"
