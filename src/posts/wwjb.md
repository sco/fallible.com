      Whooah...  
        
      I had already read the comments from Lori but suddenly I just had to read them again!  
        
      Take Care

I'm afraid I might have scared people off with my recent post, "Maybe It Takes A Blogosphere."  
  
Doug and I had hit a rough patch in our writing experiment, that's all. We hadn't spoken in civil tones to one another for upwards of thirteen minutes, as often happens with couples who are together 24/7, and the pressure was more than I could take.  
  
So--since I couldn't very well turn to him without being reminded, in eloquent terms, that he was STILL waiting for my completed companion post on Engineering Physics As It Pertains To And Overlaps With Elemental Intelligent Design--I turned to you, my faithful readers.  
  
I hoped that with your combined wisdom, wit, and wackiness, the comments box would be instantly filled with enough brilliant and beautiful quotes to keep Doug and me from breaking several of the Ten Commandments of Blogging.  
  
("Thou Shalt Not Aggregiously And Without Remorse Murder Your Spouse And Blog Partner," "Thou Shalt Not Lie Through Your Teeth About The Character Of An Innocent Human Blogger," and "Thou Shalt Not Covet Another's WAY-More-Excellent-Than-Yours Blog Entry" spring immediately to mind.)  
  
My young college friend Kevin responded to my plea with a much-loved Mother Teresa quote, one we hadn't considered until now and may just use one day soon. (Thanks, Kevin...)  
  
And then Lori arrived on the comments scene. For those of you who haven't read her remarks, please do so now...  
  
I haven't had such a good laugh in a long time, a laugh which emanated from somewhere so deep within my spirit that it managed to ameliorate not only the ill feelings I've had toward my husband, but also my latent fear of breaking one of the aforementioned commands.  
  
Until, that is, I remembered Number One:  
  
"I Am The Lord Thy God. Thou Shalt Have No Other Blogs Before Me."
