Two trees are competing outside my bedroom window. One entered the race many days ago, with much less to lose than the other. My years' experience on the sidelines at these events tells me it'll cross the finish line before noon. Yesterday, the second tree hadn't even decided if it was going to play this year. As I watch it now, it is full and green and lush in the sunny, windless day. Unbelievably, hundreds of leaves per minute are pouring from its branches. It'll be stripped clean within the hour. Kind of reminds me of NaNoWriMo. Oh, yeah, it's November 1: everything reminds me of [NaNoWriMo](http://www.nanowrimo.org/).
