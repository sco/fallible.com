![laundry day](http://www.fallible.com/img/clothesline.jpg)What is it about severe weather--in this case, thunder, lightning, hail, mudslide, and tornado--that brings out the "inner laundress" in the upscale women who live near me?  
  
I was driving through a parking lot, nearly blinded by the storm, when I caught sight of a drive-thru Pride Dry Cleaners. It's like a drive-through bank, with an overhang sufficient to fully cover the car being waited on, great for inclement mornings like this.  
  
But the neighborhood's inner laundresses are not patient. The SUVs lined up single-file, eight or ten deep, winding through the parking lot till they passed the HyVee and the Subway. A couple of women put their cars in park and ran in for an Americano, clearly exasperrated with Pride's iffy service.  
  
The overhang lost its dry meaning as the establishment's employees skittered out into the ankle-deep hail stones to expidite their customers' orders. Windows were unrolled, homemakers were drenched, dry cleaning was wet.  
  
But the homemakers of Johnson County were served exactly what they asked for, and all at once. Fifteen minutes later, the sun shone brightly. All the ladies pulled into their garages, closed the doors, and heaved a sigh of relief at a hard morning's work.
