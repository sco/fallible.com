Chances are, unless you've been in the market for a new washing machine in the past six months, that you've never heard of Fisher & Paykel. They're the New Zealand-based manufacturer of machines that are all the rage in Europe and elsewhere--and apparently for good reason.  
  
When our Maytag died this week, we fully intended to invest in another one, or perhaps a Whirlpool. We looked at both brands at Lowes before the young salesman asked if he could show us an alternative.  
  
All we'd said was that we valued durability over tons of features we rarely use, and he started talking up the benefits of the Fisher & Paykel. It has so few moving parts that in the rare case it breaks down, he said, the typical owner is able to fix it without calling a repairman.  
  
The way Doug and I look at things, the fewer moving parts the better. We bought the machine and it was delivered today.  
  
The kid at Lowes said the machine should last at least 15 years, and perhaps much longer. They don't make predictions like that on any of the American machines.  
  
"Wow, babe," I said with a mixture of pride and glee, as our first load of clothes whirred efficiently in the next room. "This may be the last washing machine we ever have to buy."  
  
"Of course, that would mean we were..."  
  
"Oh, yeah... Dead."  
  
Another good reason to buy American.
