      I say just pitch the mug, but if you're really worried about the waste, you've got other options.  
        
      1) You could potentially score some cash if you put it up for auction on ebay; especially if you do something particularly keen and original with it. (ie: sign it, chisel pointless drawings into it, tape a nametag that says "Hi, I'm Earl" to it, etc)  
        
      2) There's a website whose URL is currently slipping my mind. It's similar to ebay except that it's a non-profit organization that's behind it. The basic premise is that you give stuff away. What you would normally trash is simply given away rather than auctions. I heard about it listening to Clark Howard on AM radio, but have since forgotten the location. I can keep you posted if I remember.  
        
      3) I am rather short on coffee mugs and am very much the fiend of coffee; so if you want to you could mail it to me. I guarantee it'll either be used for drinking coffee, or will be sent to its destruction in a spectacular fashion (ala explosive or projectile, not just dropping it in the circular file). Either way it'd be keen, and you won't have to worry about waste. There's a high degree of utility in a mug that's used in either drinking or entertaining destruction. I can even send you updates on how it is used.  
        
      Wow, now wouldn't that be exciting.  
      Well now I'm getting wordy. If brevity really is the soul of wit, I'm about as witty as Polonius.

      two words - goodwill bag. mine is next to my front door, under the coats on hooks and next to the eternal pile of shoes. when it's full, it goes in the car, to town, and up that neat little ramp my salvation army has at their drop off point...

      Adam--"We have a winner!" Hey, email me your postal address and I'll send you an early Christmas present....  
        
      Lisa and Kevin--You know what? I've given away so much stuff (and taken the tax deduction...) in the past few months, that I think that's why this freaky mug is standing out like...a really freaky mug. It must have been hiding under the seat of the car or something when I was de-cluttering, because I got rid of all the other ugly mugs! Aha...I just had my Kevin vacuum out all the cars the other day. That explains the dicey mug! Thanks for helping me solve the mystery...  
        
      Lydia--I wish I could promise you that advanced age would solve a woman's tendency to obsess about dumb stuff but, alas, what kind of a service would I be rendering to lie to you like that? All I can say is: Mugs Happen. :)

Maybe you wouldn't call this a moral dilemma, but there are mugs in my kitchen cabinet that I wouldn't be caught dead swigging coffee from. And there are others that are my favorites. Even if they're too small or too large to be practical for my particular java-consuming habits, I like the message on them. Or the people who gave them to me. Either way.  
  
The problem with a favorite mug is that every time you use it, you risk breaking it, after which time you will never use it again. This is what happened with a recent fave of mine which read: "Chocolate. The fifth major food group." It's minus its handle now, but can I part with it? No, I cannot.  
  
My current favorite is one my mother gave me for a red-letter birthday. It says, in brown letters, "40. Thank you for not laughing." Seeing as how I'm nearly 51, no one is laughing now...  
  
The mug I will not use under any circumstances, even if it means I must remain coffeeless, has no slogan. Instead it bears a photograph of a pair of dice. I don't know why the dice affect me like they do. Maybe it's that they remind me so much of plush dice hanging from a rearview mirror. And plush reminds me of fur, which reminds me of hair, which I don't like to find mixed up with my coffee.  
  
I've thought about throwing the perfectly good, handle-intensive but dicey mug into the trash, and no one in the house would give me a bit of trouble if I did. But I would feel guilty about the waste, I'm thinking.  
  
And then I really would have a moral dilemma.
