    text: "Bethany, I must say your pens of choice sound lovely. (Much preferred to running up against someone called Ballpoint Ben.) Because you are a discriminating pen user, I have reason to believe you would love to own and use a fountain pen. Check in the display cases at Office Depot. They're under lock and key, they're that good."

    text: "You know, we were in a schooling system where till the age of 12 (standard VI from standard III) we were allowed to use only fountain pens. They were messy\"¦but like you I developed the love for fluidity and a result an appreciably good handwriting. These days I touch the ebonite keyboards more often than a fountain pen and your post made me dream! Thanks friend!"

I purchased another fountain pen yesterday, the second one in a month. I've entertained a lifelong intrigue with fluidity, the graceful, effortless motion of hand and heart, the very essence of penmanship produced with a fountain pen.  
  
If you learned to write in cursive with such an instrument, the redeeming virtues of all other pens are lost on you. You handle a fountain pen with a sense of purpose, having had the importance of your undertaking impressed upon you by the likes of Sr. Sheila Ann, Sr. Rose Ellen, and Sr. Kathleen Patrick, in that order. (By the time you reached 8th grade and Sr. Agatha Francis, ballpoint pens were infiltrating even the Catholic schools, and the beautiful penmanship movement was crumbling from within.)  
  
It was the Palmer Method the Sisters of St. Joseph taught us, and I might have found it unacceptable that they all wrote identically, if they hadn't all written perfectly. Indeed, a girl who conquered the techniques of the Palmer Method as well as I did was often found to have a vocation to the sisterhood in the bargain. The two went pen in hand.  
  
I've been a calligrapher since Scotty was a baby, when I took formal lessons and mastered the basics. It proved a wonderful creative venture for me, even helping to supplement our income, until five-year-old Scott spilled an entire bottle of indelible black India ink on the dining room carpet, and the spell was broken.  
  
It is calling me again.  
  
I am now pursuing the art of Spencerian Penmanship, much like the Palmer Method of my childhood, but with the extravagant flourishes I've come to crave.  
  
Sure, I still buy 10 Bics for a buck like everyone else. But it's getting harder and harder to sign my name with such an imposter, without remembering the life's work of the good sisters, and repenting.
