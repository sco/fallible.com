    text: "Yes. Doug can play most instruments (drums, guitar, piano, sax, clarinet, Irish whistles and Irish bagpipes...) so I know that's the deal. Always a song in his mind. I tap, too, but only when I am extremely nervous, angry, or anxious. Other people's tapping strangely elicits those emotions in me!! I try to be patient, Lisa, really I do...."

The entire transcript of another very weird conversation:  
  
Katy: "Honey, I love you..." (Her voice trails off.)  
  
Doug: "But...?"  
  
Katy: "Oh. My. God...*BUT*."  
  
Doug: "Okay. What?"  
  
Katy: "It's the tapping. It's got to go."  
  
Doug: "Oh, yeah. That."
