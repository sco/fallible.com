      oh boy, that made me laugh. my mom is always on my brothers' case about making sure the shower curtain is INSIDE the tub. i'm afraid the toilet seat is, however, a losing battle...

I hesitate to tell my husband that he keeps closing the shower curtain in a way which is causing water to puddle on the bathroom floor. He'd try to do better, I know, and he wouldn't mind me mentioning it. It's just that I know him too well. If he focuses on the shower curtain, he'll space out something else and tonight, in the darkness, I'll fall bottom-first into the toilet. A woman learns to choose her complaints.
