      When my daughter was on college, she would spend the weekend with us and drive back to school on Monday morning (it was only 30 miles away). She would go out with friends after church on Sunday night and sometimes stay out very late. I never worried about what she was doing but I worried about what could happen to her. I would lay awake till I knew she was home while my wife slept oblivious to the terrors that lived in my imagination.  
      She got married three years ago and the day of the wedding I quit worrying about her. For a while I felt guilty that I wasn't losing any sleep. But I got over it. I still love her and care about what happens to her. But when she moved out from under my roof for good I was no longer responsible for her.  
      I realize now what I should have known all along. I really can't protect my children. I can't solve all their problems. But I don't have to worry. They're in God's hands.

      The roommate of eldest step-daughter, Tiffany, during her final year of college (until she decides to go for the Masters) was from the interior of Mexico. I didn't think much of it, Ana was very nice.  
        
      One day I got a call from Tiffany saying she was on the road about to drive "to Ana's house" and wanted to chat a moment before losing the cell signal.  
        
      It took me a moment or two before I realized she was telling me was driving deep into Mexico. This 21 year old and her 20 year old female friend.  
        
      I am personally petrified of driving in Mexico. I don't do it. I park in the USA and walk over. I get a cab, or whatever to do the driving. I close my eyes and pray.  
        
      I "gently" expressed my concerns to Tiffany about the dangers...there are bandits..people drive like nut cases, even more than they do in Texas, you can't trust the police, it's not safe.  
        
      Tiffany then told me, "Oh, we do this all the time....this is just the first time I called you."  
        
      I'm still not sure I feel any better about it.

      And the college stories begin.....Michael's story reminds me of something I did this past year. My best friend and I goto college about 5 hours away from each other. One late-night this past Spring we decided that I was going to sneak away one weekend, go pick her up at her school, and bring her back to mine for the weekend.  
        
      It was a good plan until we got about 2 hours from Omaha(where I goto school) and ended up in a ditch on the "bad" side of Des Moines. Thank goodness for AAA. Parents weren't too happy when they found out at first, but they got over it. I would definitely say, though, that it was all worth it and that we had a great time.

I'm a nervous Nellie when it comes to highway driving in torrential rains, hail storms, and tornadoes. I just am.  
  
Carrie was home for five days--so much fun, such wonderful bonding!--and needed to head back to her college town at a certain hour if she was to keep an appointment. The rains were so blinding by then that I was a wreck before she even picked up her keys.  
  
My nervousness sent me to the bathroom several times in rapid succession as Carrie nonchalantly gathered her laundry, ransacked the pantry, and scooped up her can't-travel-without-them seven or eight pairs of shoes.  
  
I was wishing she could wait out the storm, but realizing she couldn't. Still, she seemed to be moving in aggravating slow motion, which drove me crazy. The way I look at it, if you have to do something you're dreading, the sooner you get started, the sooner you'll be done.  
  
"I'm about to leave," she finally announced. "right after I pee."  
  
"*Again*?" I asked.  
  
"*Eh*," she said, looking bewildered and so, so blonde. "Oh my gosh, did I just, like, *pee*?"  
  
"Um, on second thought," I said, "maybe that was *me*."  
  
Did I mention that we're close?
