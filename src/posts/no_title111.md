"Lord, I need a sign," I hear myself say aloud. The very sound of it shocks me. I can count on one hand the number of times I've asked for a sign in thirty years of following Jesus. You know that prayer, "God, if You're really up there, You're going to have to give me a sign?" I've never prayed that one. And then there's "Father in heaven, if you really love me, You're going to have to show me." That one doesn't fly with me, either. The Scripture contains all the proof I need of His existence and His love. When I pray for a sign, it's direction I'm seeking. Maybe the signs are already in place, with street names and highways clearly marked. Maybe I've even been equipped with a global positioning satellite system in my spirit, so I know where I am. Now, if I only knew where I was going, I'd know which path to take. U2 sings that on this road "believing is seeing." So I revise my prayer. "Lord, help my unbelief."
