      the pointsetta should probably be pruned to handle the legginess...as for your mother, your bright presence, the care and judicious wisdom you bring to her life is most likely contributing to the positive side of her health...not that i profess to know for sure, it just seems appropriate to say.

"Move it over there into the sun," my mother says of the flowering plant my sister Liz gave her just a few weeks ago. "Maybe we can bring it back."  
  
Who knows why it has begun to prematurely fade? We are not horticulturists, my mother and I. We only know how to putz and putter, water and sun, and hope for the best.  
  
"Jim James gave me the poinsettia for Christmas last year," she says, pointing to the only other vegetative life in her apartment. "It's looking pretty iffy to me."  
  
The plant is leggy and gangly, pathetic looking, really. It passed its prime last winter sometime, and has somehow eluded being tossed out in the trash.  
  
If its owner had been paying attention, she would have ditched it months ago. It's a good thing she's not overly-vigilent.  
  
"Look closer at it, Mom. Look at all the new growth, the tiny, pale green leaves. I think it's going to be with us for another Christmas. What do you think?"  
  
"Maybe so," she said, smiling "It's coming back around, isn't it?"  
  
Yes, I thought. And so are you, Mom. So are you.
