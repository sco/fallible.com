      Mom-  
      I never sleep with anything in my bed, but I find the oddest things in my roommate's bed. I'm talking anything from framed photos to writing utensils to candy to old mail to CD's. Once I even found a pair of scissors.

      On the few nights when Beloved Wife is away, I'm more prone to lie right in the middle of the bed and make sure that, on those little mini-wakings that occur between dusk and dawn, I roll from one side to the other.  
      In my first marriage, as my wife and I settled into careers in nursing, corrections and security, it became clear that a single bed wasn't going to work with one of us always waking while the other was trying to get to sleep. We ended up in separate rooms and separate beds; and hers would've made a fine trove for archeologists in centuries to come. Books, newspapers, knitting projects, snack dishes awaiting removal to the kitchen ... as fine a sampling of late 20th Century America At Home as could be asked! The bed was seldom made as it was an hour-long process. The drawback was that, after her death, my mother-in-law went in to clean the thing up and emerged saying, "If she wasn't dead, I'd kill her!"  
        
      I guess the message is: Beware, ye bed clutterers; there are some things you don't want to live on in memory!

      Now see? My daughter's the only "normal" person here! Let's give her some time...she'll come around.  
        
      The scissor story frighens me a little, although a few times when I thought I heard noises in the house, I put a nice sharp pair in the nightstand drawer. What I thought myself capable of doing with them, I can't imagine...  
        
      Head's up: Don't sleep with chocolate, as tempting and delicious an idea as that might be! God forbid that the bed bugs should bite your Hershey's kisses!

      Lisa--Little kids are the most active sleepers in the world! I don't know how they get any rest...  
        
      Lydia--Ah, yes. Well, you will need to marry someone very secure in his manhood...  
        
      Kristy--We do what we must to make sure our men believe that they're the only ones. :)

Presuming you find yourself alone in bed at least on rare occasions, do you pile non-sleep-related stuff into the bed with you?  
  
In my post on books-to-be-read (see below), [Michael Main](http://www.michaelmain.com/2004_11_01_theach.html#109974558060348566) says that while his dear wife Amy recovers from surgery on the couch, the bed is filled with books. He even claims on his blog to have slept, in Amy's absence, with some guy named Chuck, but we won't go there.  
  
If Doug's out of town, an assortment of Dougie substitutes ends up on his side, although they bear no resemblance in either form or function to the fellow they replace. On any given night, I might gather unto myself several remotes, my iBook, a flashlight just in case, the printout of his flight and hotel information, a Country Living magazine, the baby afghan I'm crocheting, a Bible, a teddy bear, and a huge container of Tums.  
  
Even at that, I think I'm less kooky than my dear friend JoAnn. We were roommates in our youth, and she spent every night with a giant pile of unpaid, overdue bills. I can't imagine she got a lot of rest.  
  
I don't want to know who's in your bed, OK? But if you want to share what's in your bed, that would be fun.
