      Of course, when I say I need to focus on a segment of readers, I mean to sell a book idea.  
        
      For my blog, I remain devotedly unfocused. That is my commitment to you!

      I understand the need to usually focus on a segment of the market to hone in on to increase sales. But this is a book, and it has me a bit confused.  
        
      If God gives you the ability to write stuff that many, many different types of people enjoy (blog or not), why wouldn't you want to stuff that into a book? I guess I think if you wrote a book that multiple sectors of the market would enjoy, then more books would be sold (assuming, of course, it is a good read). More sectors = more readers = more sold?  
        
      I don't know the ins and outs of the book business, so feel free to disregard me. But if God has given you the ability to speak to multiple people-types, I'd say don't push it away!

      In our reality TV crazed world, it's obvious that people are interested in how other people live.  
      They also need role models other than sports heroes and movie stars. Someone like you who is an 'every day' approachable sort of person who has hurts, triumphs, annoyances, and pleasures that we all can relate to would be a tremendous pleasure to read in book form. The Dave Barry's of the world have proven that to me. He's just an average sort of writer guy who sees things in an above average humorous, yet HONEST way. Much like you do.  
        
      The world is craving realism, but they are craving wholesome realism. Ask anyone who refuses to watch the news or won't read a newspaper. They will all tell you that there is too much bad news and not enough good. Your blog is informative, entertaining, and gives us an insight into another Christian sister's hopes, dreams, and family life. That's a best seller in my opinion.  
        
      Blessings,

      Kevin--Sometimes people who supposedly "know nothing about" an industry are the ones whose opinions should be most considered! I value yours, and believe you're more humble than you should be about how much you intuit.  
        
      Jackie--Erma is one of my heroines. Her best columns could make you laugh, then cry, then laugh again. All in a few hundred words. What a class act...I would be thrilled to emulate her in even some small way.  
        
      Michelle--Wow! Thanks for the vote of confidence. You've kind of lit a fire under me, lady! I've been to your site several times now, but still haven't clicked on any of your short stories. I'm going to. They look enticing and I'm looking forward to devoting some time to enjoying them. :)

    text: "Yes Katy, marketing a blog or site compared to a book is different. It would be great if people could use the same marketing techniques, but of course they are just like every other market out there-different. It's good to see your blog doing well and I wish you the best, thanks for sharing and giving back."

This may be the most gratifying 24 hours I've ever spent as a blogger!  
  
I LOVE it that so many of you stepped up to the comment plate. Carrie K, the first commenter, asked if I'm in talks with any agents, editors, or publishers. Nothing official to report at this point. A number of good working relationships, though, and high hopes that I can put together proposals which will meet their needs.  
  
One thing I've grappled with, when I'm crafting a proposal, is how to describe my target readership. If I pitch a book of short essays loosely based on some of the entries here, is my target audience middle-aged mothers of grown children? Is it women who are caring for kooky (and by kooky I mean, of course, entertaining) mothers--and mothers-in-law?  
  
Is it couples of all ages who are curious about how a long-term married couple hangs on for dear life? Is it singles who wonder if their own moms are even on this planet, and they read me to find out? (Sorry, kids, that I can't be of more help!)  
  
People of faith? Conservatives? Liberals? Pre-Emergents? Emergents? Never-to-be-Emergents?  
  
People who just like to read goofy stories about pantyhose and other constrictive undergarments?  
  
Well, book pitches aside, at least now I know more about who reads fallible. All kinds of great people! Too bad book marketing departments don't go for it when an author says, "This book is meant for absolutely everyone."  
  
So I'm going to have to focus on a segment of the reading population, and focusing isn't my forte.  
  
Any suggestions?
