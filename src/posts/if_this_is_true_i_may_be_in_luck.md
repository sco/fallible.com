      Bethany, I'm thinking your Mom did a darned good job!  
        
      Lisa, Recently I found a set of five thank-you notes, written and sealed with names on the front, that I'd written after my WEDDING in 1977. I couldn't find the addressees' addresses, so they never got sent. I saw two of the people recently, and handed them their cards, and they got the BIGGEST kick out of it! The rest of the intended recipients are dead, and I feel some sorrow that they may have taken a resentment toward me to their final address!

      Katy,  
        
      On that note, let me thank you. :) You have written some gorgeous thoughts lately. You inspire me! My life-word this year is gratitude. I'm a very thankful person, but not always in the ways that people find acceptable. With lots of little ones, sometimes somebody eats a couple thank you notes (or better yet, the whole list). I started out somewhere this year to set aside a whole day of thankfulness (the kids and I writing thank you cards and just picking somebody who has been a blessing and hanging out with them) but somewhere the weight of life (the Aslett kind) smothered my intent. There's still a little time left in this year, I'm going to give it a go...staring with you.  
        
      Thanks again, for your kind heart and open hands.  
        
      Blessings,  
      Mary
