      Next time you see me ask me about the time my aunt came into my room at four in the morning to let me know (because I "was interested in politics") that she was now the acting president of the United States.

    text: "April--I tried mowing once. Actually, once with an old-fashioned non-electric rotary mower, which was too heavy for me to push, and once on our riding mower. I'm too short to reach the pedals on it, so I'm off the mowing hook! Someday, though, I'm going to go to one of those car washes where you do it yourself. I've been thinking about that one for a while, so I think it's time....Have fun!"

      Yes, the psych ward is certainly interesting, eh? ;) I'm glad you went. Many people simply can't bring themselves to go there.  
        
      God willing, I hope that I will be accepted to the psychiatry program at Columbia (in NYC). I've had my entire education in California, and I'm thinking it's time to try something new.  
        
      God willing, of course.

      Maria, New York would be a wonderful change and a great experience. I'm always surprised by how willing God turns out to be when I'm ready!  
        
      Psych unit: Wow. My mom felt pretty OK by comparison, with only depression and anxiety troubling her. Interesting dynamic in which to attempt to get better!

      Oooh, Lisa, you're a publisher! Doug and I published a newsletter for our church at one point, and an issue "hot off the press" was always exciting!  
        
      Peter--Oh those pesky illegalities! (I have no doubt but that you're gearing up for something big!)

      Hmm, I bought a car for the first time a handful of months ago.  
        
      And not only that, I did it in a foreign country.  
        
      And not ONLY that, it was a stick shift, and when I handed over the cash (yes, cash) to pay for it, I as yet didn't know how to drive it.  
        
      I think those count for a lot of "never done something before"s!

    text: "Lisa, We had a stick shift which we purchased together the year we got married. I was sure that my mellow husband, who was never a priest, could teach me how to drive it. I tried but I could NOT get the hang of it. Better that I should quit trying than end up divorced."

Here's a question that's more challenging the older you get, and since I'll turn fifty soon, I'm plenty challenged:  
  
"When was the last time you did something you've never done before?"  
  
Being a visitor in a psych unit was new for me, an experience everyone should have at least once. I don't, however, plan to expand my resume by becoming a patient there.  
  
I'm also getting a little professional counseling, a first for me--not because I haven't needed it, but because I'm chicken.  
  
How about you? Do you intentionally stretch yourself by taking on new experiences? I'm curious.
