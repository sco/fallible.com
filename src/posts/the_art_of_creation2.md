      I saw something similar during a music festival a few years back. The artist was doing an amazing landscape in chalk on a large black sheet behind the band, and I was mesmerized.

      It's interesting you touched on this topic.. We've started going thru the Bible in Sunday school again...starting at Genesis and we simply skipped over that whole evolution, creation, intelligent design debate because Gordon said, "Those arguments all focus on the how...we're hear to learn about the Who."  
        
      Know matter where you draw the line on creation...the Creator is where our focus should be.

      Gee I hope I didn't just stir up a stink ...it would be far too circular if I did :)

      Amber--Watching an artist create something out of nearly nothing is so amazing. I'm not afraid to put words on blank paper, but I'm a bit shy about ruining a canvas. Weird, huh?  
        
      Deb--It was so cool. Have you seen anything like it during worship?  
        
      Michael--You troublemaker, you!! I am happy if Allegra enjoys visiting your site and mine. I hope she comments here...  
      I think I agree with Gordon and you on this one. However, our pastor did a great job of focusing on the Creator even as he broached this complicated (read: boring...) subject.  
        
      And the artist helped me get through the service awake!

Creation Science has never held my interest. Even when we moved on to Intelligent Design, I balked.  
  
Don't get me wrong. I'm a big believer in God as Creator of the whole shebang--big bang, or not. It would be difficult to believe that our heavenly Father is involved in the smallest details of our lives (like numbering the very hairs on our heads and the grains of sand around the seas, and caring for the fates of humble sparrows and the lilies of the field), but that He wasn't the benevolent force behind the origin of everything.  
  
Maybe it was the word "science" that got me down. From Physical Science, to Biology, to Chemistry, to Physics--I've never gotten it. I was a language girl myself. Give me a full schedule of English, French, Spanish, Literature, and Creative Writing, with weekends full of Speech, Theater, and Debate, and I was a happy kid. But just mention the word Science, with all the Ds and C minuses inherent in the word, and I flinched.  
  
Still do, I guess.  
  
I knew in advance that this morning's message at church was going to be about Intelligent Design. I could have stayed home and waited for the reruns tonight. After all, Doug is always reading books in bed like "Darwin's Black Box" and giving me the condensed-version explanation. He knows it helps me sleep. (Yawn...)  
  
But I went, and I didn't pay attention to a word the pastor said. I didn't have to.  
  
You see, all during the singing and then seamlessly throughout the message, a man stood silently upon the stage with an easel and brush and painted. No one introduced him or referred to him in any way. The canvas was blank before the music began. Slowly a stormy seascape began to emerge, one with a mountain off to one side and a brilliant setting sun sinking beneath dark clouds.  
  
I was mesmerized.  
  
For an hour and a half, the creator shaped his artistic vision on the canvas. Many times, he stepped back to peer at it from a distance. More than once, he scratched his chin or shook his head, stepped up to the work again, and made corrections. I found myself trying to predict where his brush might land next, whether he might feel the need to sharpen the angles of the mountain or tone down the reflection of the sun on the angry waters.  
  
Sometimes, I could almost feel with the creator exactly what needed to happen to the edge of the cloud or the breaking wave, and wasn't surprised when he felt the same way. Other times, he caught me off guard with the freshness of his insight and the sensitivity of his touch. Through it all, I wept.  
  
By the end of the service, [Mark Christopher Weber](http://www.batguano.com/century/weber.html) had completed his painting, and members of the congregation gathered around him to talk about its beauty. Just looking at his creation made them recognize and appreciate the artist.  
  
I may not know much about Intelligent Design, but I've encountered the Creator like never before.
