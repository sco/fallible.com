Night before last, Rudy Guilliani called. I hung up on him. He's a great guy and everything, but still. Last night, Doug answered the phone. He didn't say much, but his eyes got big and he looked excited. "It's Julia Louis-Dreyfuss," he said, "and she's really angry!" He gets a thrill out of angry women. "She wants us to vote for Jean Carnahan, and protect a woman's right to choose," he said. For a moment, I thought he was almost persuaded. "Bye-bye, Julia," I said, as I reached out one finger and hit the disconnect. Just protecting my right to choose.
