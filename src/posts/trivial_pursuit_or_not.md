![IRAQ](http://www.fallible.com/iraq_map.gif)Any guesses who might have said this, referring to Saddam Hussein?  
  
"Lets imagine the future. What if he fails to comply and we fail to act, or we take some ambiguous third route, which gives him yet more opportunities to develop this program of WMD? He will conclude that the international community has lost its will. He will then conclude that he can go right on and do more to rebuild an arsenal of devastating destruction. And some day, some way, I guarantee you he'll use the arsenal."
