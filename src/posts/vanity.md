      How true.<br><br>I was discussing something similar with my friends recently... why is it that we all cannot accept God's timeline, and insist that things go OUR way?

    text: "Dear Preacher,<br>Ouch. Your def of using God's name in vain is just a little personal! So, if I pray my laundry list of requests (regardless of concern for whether or not those requests are according to God's will) and then add a flippant \"in Jesus' name,\" that could (theoretically and hypothetically, of course) be taking God's name in vain? Well. Now you have, as they say, taken to meddling! ;)<br><br>Yes, Jesus' standards all the way, since He is gracious enough to add His mercy to the mix. Otherwise, we'd all be fugitives from His justice--I'm not that great of a runner. :)"

![10 for 10](http://www.fallible.com/10commands.gif)There's a pretty good chance I've broken every one of the Ten Commandments in thought, word, or deed. But I have to say that one of them, for me, stands out as awfully hard to break.  
  
I've intended to take the Lord's name in vain countless times, with an abysmal failure rate.  
  
I scream "JESUS!" so energetically while narrowly averting a car wreck that any listener would imagine I'm taking His name in vain, but I'm a fraud, really. Often, I add "Mary, and Joseph!" and cross myself without even realizing it, and my cover is blown.  
  
Bidden, or unbidden, He is present, and He tacitly turns my feeble attempts at blasphemy into answered prayers.  
  
Still, the commandment gnaws at me today. Something about it makes me seek out a second opinion, just to verify my innocence.  
  
"I doubt the commandment has much to do with cussing. I think it's about something else entirely," Doug says.  
  
Oh-oh.  
  
"I think it's about presenting yourself, your words, your lifestyle and your choices to others as if you're following the Lord, when you're not. It's about attaching His name to efforts He'd rather not be associated with. It's about being presumptuous enough to believe that God himself is behind all your schemes, plans and ideas without checking with Him first."  
  
So, I'm ten for ten, after all.
