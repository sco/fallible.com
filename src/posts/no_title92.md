    text: "Jani--Wow, a \"swollen optic nerve\" buddy! You're my first! Ooooh, the \"thought I was going blind thing\" sounds so scary. My vision is OK, except peripherally, and that might be because I'm OLD. And I'm getting a cataract, which is also consistent with my advanced AGE. Tee, hee. I've had a brain tumor on my hearing nerve, had it removed in Nov 99, and have no hearing in one ear. I'd really not like to lost sight, too! Boy, we've really got to fight to hang onto what remains, don't we? Best wishes for regaining all your sight, and thanks for visiting!"

      I happened upon your site completely by accident and thought how ironic you would make such a post.<br>I had a swollen optic nerve about two years ago (optic neuritis) and thought I was going blind. And then to be told it could be MS and I neede dan MRI, jesus could it have been a better day? Thankfully it was nothing (so they claimed some fluke) and I was off to wait for the vision to slowly come back (has never gotten back to 100% but I can finally see red again) so good luck to you and great site!!!!

One minute your doc calls to say the MRI of your head is completely normal (in spite of the swollen optic nerve the opthamologist saw), the next minute you decide to go ahead with your planned trip to New York in spite of FBI warnings, and the next minute your whole family is packing bags and hi-tailing it to KCI. MRI, FBI, KCI. As Ricky Ricardo would say, "I, I, I, I, I..." Only with an accent.
