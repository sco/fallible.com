      i'm the thirty - year old, not -something- exhausted mom on autopilot...i struggle to make a choice for making choices sake daily, i am in constant ready-to-rescue-a-toddler mode, i am sighed at, argued with, and still feel largely overwhelmed to take up this high and holy calling most days. but still...there is that (though often faint) unmistakable sign of a blessing in all this. a smile from God, a purposefulness that can't be avoided. i live in the bright reality of it...and i believe.

Hang on for dear life to every encouraging word that is spoken to you, whether from God, spouse, child, friend or dog!!<br><br>Preach, If your little girl invites you to watch Mr. Roger's reruns because she knows it makes YOU happy, you're much further along in the process than you know!! It will turn out well for you, I feel certain."

    text: "Lisa, It is SO true. I once heard a preacher speak on \"you reap what you sow,\" and he spoke of farming. He said, \"You reap WHAT you sow; you reap AFTER you sow, and you reap MORE THAN you sow.\" Sowing into your children's lives, little bits, early and often, will reap a wonderful harvest--you just have to wait a while!"

"I believe in you," he says to the young woman, and kisses her until she agrees to accept his belief.  
  
She's a brand new mother, and a nervous one, inexperienced and unsure of herself, but hopeful. They gaze with adoration at the infant son in her arms, and pray hard.  
  
How will she be able to provide all this child will need? Will she apprehend the grace of God, reach out to grasp what He freely gives, and meet the challenges of motherhood for all the years that stretch before them?  
  
"I believe in you," he says to the thirty-something, exhausted woman.  
  
She struggles to keep up with the demands of three children, their fledgling business, their home, and especially their faith. He helps her with all his strength, but still every move of hers seems dictated by sheer necessity, seldom by choice. She is on automatic pilot for years, she thinks, directed here and there by the crisis du jour, by the need of the hour.  
  
What's to believe?  
  
"I believe in you," he says, to the older, freer woman, the one whose child-raising responsibilities have been largely fulfilled, and whose children have risen up and called her blessed, right to her face.  
  
She is starting over again, and she knows it, and she's afraid. She smiles at him, and nods, but when he turns away, she cries.  
  
"He believes in me," she says to herself, and once again she prays hard to apprehend that for which she has been apprehended by God, reaching to become the woman He's called her to be.  
  
And she thanks God for the unbelieveable gift of a believing husband.  
  
He believes in me.
