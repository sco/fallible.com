    text: "o wow! it's so much more fun to think of this sort of thing as a fun game instead of obsessive-compulsive behavior! not that you're obsessive/ compulsive, either of you - but i've often identified with that and it's a relief to find levity amongst the overactive minds :)"

"Are you playing the game?" I asked the young man who was checking my groceries. It was difficult not to notice how efficiently he was bagging. "What game?" "You know, the one where you try to see if you can finish bagging the groceries before the customer finishes writing the check." "I've never heard of that game." "I've never heard of it, either," I explain. "But when I used to check groceries, I played it all the time." "No, I'm not playing it," he said. I ripped off the check and slapped it down on the counter one nano-second before he added the eggs to the top of the bag. Everybody plays the game.
