      Well, after my John Kerry/John Edwards train experience about a month ago in the 'burg (see my own blog entry about this one), the Bush experience certainly paled in comparison. And that's an understatement. From the enclosed window, or so my husband says because he apparently waved at him, of the bus of the motorcade, Bush spoke a mere five words to the hundreds of supporters who had gathered on the courthouse lawn, including many schoolchildren and the high school band playing "God Bless America." Hoping to be inspired with words of wisdom or encouragement for a stronger future for America, Bush spoke into his microphone as he passed quickly down the street. He said, "Just wanted to say hi." Yep, that's our President... Needless to say, I think he lost a few votes today.

Perhaps he thinks they are more vote-worthy than a huge crowd gathered in front of a county courthouse, waving American flags and shouting his name. Then again, maybe he was just hungry. Either way, I still think he lost out on votes."

      Yes, he was hungry! No presidential candidate, incumbent or otherwise, passes up the photo op to be shown eating BBQ in Kansas City!! If the Town Square in Warrensburg had included not only every school child and marching band and flag-waver and protester in the county, but also a huge and aromatic stand of Fiorella's JackStack BBQ, I GUARANTEE you the Prez would have slammed the brakes on that motorcade!  
        
      Wouldn't you? (If you smoke it, they will come....)

My sister Bridget, not a President Bush fan, is nonetheless going to be in an audience of his in less than a hour in Warrensburg, Missouri.  
  
And she's pretty darned excited!  
  
The president just finished speaking to a crowd of ten thousand at Lee's Summit High School, and is scheduled to speak in Sedalia in two hours. The local news doesn't even seem to know he's stopping in Warrensburg, but Bridget's got an inside scoop.  
  
Her hubby, Jim, is a Warrensburg cop, who just got pulled in this morning to do security for Bush's impromptu stop.  
  
You heard it here first! While unaware Warrensburgers are lined up along Highway 50 between Lee's Summit and Sedalia, waving flags from the beds of their pick-up trucks, Bridget and Jim will be within arm's length of the man.  
  
ETA: 11:15 am, according to my brother-in-law, who ought to know.
