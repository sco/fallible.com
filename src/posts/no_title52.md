I sit at my tiny table at Starbuck's, turn on my keyboard, and take my much-anticipated first sip of Latte Breve with Sugar-Free Vanilla Syrup. Before I write one word, I notice a businesswoman, dressed in a perfect outfit for early fall, poised intently over her laptop, typing away. It is clear from my first impression that she types 80 words per minute, with no errors. There is no cup on her table. Does she really come in here only to work, and not to imbibe? I take another sip and feel ashamed. I write several words in a row without stopping either to sip or to glance again at the ambition personified and seated on my left. When I finally hazard a peek, it is as before. Have I mentioned the artistic precision of her coiffure, the sensible beauty of her shoes, and the chip-free condition of her manicure? And that she has no zits? Rarely have I observed a woman so dedicated to her pursuit, so unrivaled in her ability to concentrate surrounded by the most intoxicating aromas on earth. She is undeterred from advancing her accomplishments, undistracted by my glaring deficit of comparable professionalism, determined only to type. After composing several halfway decent paragraphs myself, I slink out of the shop, sure she has outperformed me, and that she knows it. And then I wonder: Might she have been similarly in awe of me, typing away with what must have looked to her like supreme confidence, every time she looked my way? Who's to say she wasn't mystified by my flight of fingers, transfixed by my expressive engagement, and inspired by my Casual Tuesday apparel? Turning around, I head back in for another go at it.
