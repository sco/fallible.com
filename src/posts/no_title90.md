Things I Wish I'd Said: Third or Possibly Fourth In a Series "I have found that the best way to give advice to your children is to find out what they want and then advise them to do it." Harry S Truman, from a television interview on May 27, 1955 Since I was only a baby when Mr. Truman made his comment, I can be excused for not coming up with it first. Still, with kids ages 23, 20 and 17, I sure wish I'd had a thought even reasonably close to it a little earlier.
