I belong to this really great writers group called [American Christian Fiction Writers](http://www.americanchristianfictionwriters.com). We have an email loop that is always entertaining, encouraging, and educational. Not all of us have had our fiction published yet, but the published authors among us are so generous with their time and input.  
  
[Kristin Billerbeck](http://www.kristinbillerbeck.com), author of several fun chick lit books including "What A Girl Wants" and "She's Out of Control," is one of the most helpful members of our group, and guess what? She's going to be interviewed on The Today Show this Thursday, March 24, at (we think) 8:30 EST. I haven't been following Today's series called "Faith In America," but Kristin's segment is part of that.  
  
So, for a good time, watch Kristin. She's talented, kindhearted, and an excellent role model for the chicks of America.  
  
Oh, and don't just watch Kristin. Read her, too!
