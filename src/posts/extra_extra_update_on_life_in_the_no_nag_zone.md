      Sweet. Go for more! Reminds me of when we had a cam corder years ago and taped one Christmas morning. I saw in living color how I never stopped giving instructions to the kids, never wiped that grim, disapproving look off my face - I still cringe when I see it.

As unbelievable as it seems, this is the beginning of Day Four of what started as a One Day Only Special Commitment to stop nagging my husband.  
  
You people might as well know the truth. It had gotten ugly around here. My poor spouse had become so dependent on my directions that he couldn't remember to shave for an important meeting unless I complained about the whisker burn he gave me with his good-bye kiss.  
  
When a wife's gotten to where she nags while kissing, things have gone too far.  
  
On Sunday morning, when I decided on the spur of the moment that the Sabbath would be also known as Dougie Raymond's Day Off, I figured it would take all the grace God could dispense for me to keep my commitment. He might even have to withhold grace from some other needy sinners just to come up with enough of the commodity to bail me out. OK, bad theology, but suffice it to say, that's how desperate my need felt.  
  
Sunday was as tricky and mine-filled as the first day of a diet--replete with the headache and shakes common to any cold-turkey withdrawal. But I got through it with no major slip-ups. So what did I do? I awakened on Monday morning and pronounced it Day Two.  
  
"How are you doing with this, babe?" I asked. "Should I try it for another day?"  
  
"It's OK," he said. "But it does seem to me that in your effort not to bug me, you're not talking at all..."  
  
He was right about that. If I told you how many times I've slapped my hands over my mouth in mid-nag, and then said something like, "Oh, you know what? I think I just won't say that, after all..." you'd be shocked.  
  
Tuesday, Dougie Raymond's Third Day Off, had its challenges. He had an important meeting to which he went unshaved. By the time he got home, I'd had a few hours to obsess about the list of honey-dos that hadn't had any check marks applied to them for several days.  
  
"I won't ask," I said sweetly, "about whether or not you called Best Buy to clear up that problem on our receipt. And I definitely won't bother you to inquire whether or not you're getting reimbursed for the computer you bought for your mom. I would mention that you missed trash pickup again on Monday, but that might start to sound like nagging."  
  
"Everything's cool with Best Buy," he said. "I called them at noon and we worked it all out. Mom's sending a check for the computer. And Monday was Martin Luther King Day. The trash guys had a holiday."  
  
You know what? If they get a holiday, so does my man. In fact, he gets Dougie Raymond's Fourth Day Off.  
  
As for tomorrow, we'll just have to see. As the Bible says, "Each day has enough trouble of its own."
