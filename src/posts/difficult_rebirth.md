      Gee, Katy, I hope you're okay now. Electricity and sleep don't mix.

I thought of Nicodemus last night, and more than once.  
  
You remember the Pharisee who took Jesus aside under cover of darkness to ask how in the world a man could go back inside his mother's womb in order to be "born again"? Jesus told him he shouldn't be so surprised at Him saying, "You must be born again."  
  
"I have spoken to you of earthly things, and you do not believe," Jesus told Nicodemus. "How then will you believe if I speak of heavenly things?"  
  
Last night, I went to bed with a small electric heating pad attached to a very long cord. I was freezing, and after piling on the jammies, robe, socks and blankets, it was my only recourse left. I kind of shifted it around all night to whichever part of me was the coldest. Whatever works, right?  
  
Around two in the morning, I woke up choking for breath, and had already turned blue by then, I'm sure, although I didn't ask Doug for verification.  
  
"Help me!" I gasped. The cord, the very one which was to deliver the warmth of life, was wrapped around my neck three times, squeezing the life out of me, with the heating pad cast over one shoulder like a forgotten placenta.  
  
He snored in response, and I flailed around in the bed until I disentangled myself from the vestiges of a difficult birth. It wasn't pretty.  
  
I've spoken to you of earthly things, and maybe you, like Nic at night, don't believe. But I'm thinking, as night edged toward dawn, he just couldn't forget how "God so loved the world, He gave his only Son, that whosoever believes in Him shall not perish, but shall have eternal life."  
  
Around two in the morning, being born again is the best idea in the whole world.
