Evidently, American protocol dictates that no president should bow before a king or queen, although a slight bow might be considered a sign of courtesy and respect, especially when offered to a close friend of our country. In order for a bow to be considered deferential, though—-a position our leader is not supposed to assume—-the top of the president’s head must be lower than the monarch’s chin.

Whether President Obama bowed to the Saudi king in a manner that truly broke with protocol, I have no idea. But the incident got me thinking about how low I’m willing to go when bowing to the King of Kings.

On Good Friday, the day he spilled His blood for my very life, do I consider Him worthy of only the bare-basics bow? Do I calculate precisely within a fraction of an inch how slightly I might acknowledge His Kingship without actually making myself subservient to His rule?

Or do I enter His presence trembling and cast myself face first at His beautifully scarred feet?

I hope when all is said and done, when the measurements of my puny earthly kingdom are taken and recorded once and for all in His book, that He’ll reach down, lift my chin from the throne room’s floor, and allow me the unspeakable privilege of dining with Him at His banquet table.

A King and His daughter, the Redeemer and His redeemed, the Monarch of Heaven and the child for whom He died.
