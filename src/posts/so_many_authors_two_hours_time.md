      Katy, Please give my best to Rene Gutteridge when you see her. She's a good pal I met at the Mount Hermon Writer's Conference. Need proof? Follow this link to view Rene worshipping the feet I walk on:

      Michael O--I've read two of Rene's books--Boo! and Boo, Who? Both very funny and engaging. I will definitely greet her in your name!  
        
      Cindy--Nancy is a doll, isn't she? She's the person who really got be started writing for publication. We met at a local writers group, when I was a putzer and she was about to come out with her first humor book. We clicked instantly, but when she found out I wasn't actually submitting anything anywhere, she issued me an ultimatum. I took her up on her dare, and within a month, I'd had two articles accepted! I love that girl.

My closest author friend in the whole world is [Nancy Moser](http://www.nancymoser.com). If you're a reader of Christian fiction, you may have enjoyed "The Seat Beside Me," "Time Lottery," and "A Steadfast Surrender"--just to mention a few.  
  
Nancy and I do lunch fairly often, and I always manage to get her latest release autographed over salads and dessert menus (no actual desserts for us, just menus, thank you).  
  
But on Saturday, March 26, Nancy and seven other fabulous and fun authors will be appearing together in two bookstores--one in Topeka, Kansas, and the other in Olathe, Kansas.  
  
Read all about it [here](http://deborahraney.blogspot.com/).  
  
No disrespect to Jerry Jenkins or anything, but this is what I'd call a "Glorious Appearing."  
  
Hey, if you show up in Olathe, I'd love to meet you! How will you know me, you may ask? Who knows? Maybe I'll be live-blogging the event!
