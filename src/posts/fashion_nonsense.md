      i've noticed that nowadays they actually rip their jeans on the sides down to where you would usually see underwear (katy, i'll take credit for returning to this subject here at fallible..this time ;), but you just get more of a glimpse than you'd want of skin. not helped by the fact that the ends of their shirts are dangling far above their navels...well, God love 'em, I'm just glad to not be fourteen this year and feel the need to keep up.

      Seriously! Not only did the group of girls seem happy, they seemed to have structured all their fondest hopes and dreams around the possibility that jeans would go yet lower.  
        
      The news that "they're coming out with even lower jeans" had the effect of brightening the countenances of the girls, where before the news was announced by one to the others we'd noticed the young women appeared sullen, their faces downcast...

Overheard at the grocery store, when Doug and I passed by several young women with paunchy bellies overhanging their already-down-to-there pants:  
  
"Yeah, and I heard they're coming out with even lower jeans."  
  
That's just what the world needs now.
