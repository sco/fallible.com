    text: "Wow, that's ire for you--\"frickin\". ;)<br><br>Wow. It sounds like these individuals in your family has issues with body image. It sounds like you, however, are aware of their remarks to the point that part of you thinks they are absurd (the remarks, that is).<br><br>If these things were said to you over a long period of time, one can only expect that it will take a long time for you to retrain your attitudes about your own view of yourself.<br><br>Even though I have no idea what you look like, your writing makes you more beautiful than any true anorexic I have and will ever meet."

    text: "There is that phenomenon in my family too, which some like to call a genetic predisposition, which i more appropriately like to call it a generational curse, in which nearly all, if not all the women have at one point in life battled the fierceness of an eating disorder on my maternal and paternal side. Very odd. So complex, so personal, and so different in every case, doctors are constantly baffled by the complexity of how a person can self-starve themselves to the point of death, only to look in a mirror and still see that full figured fat body that drove them to this manic state of thin in the first place. I am baffled. I admire you a lot. Even though we've not met, it's always a delight to read your musings and stories. I admire you for giving an example in your personal life of how eating disorders are not just an adolescent thing, they are real and they are life threatening. I'm sorry about your Aunt, and for your father. I'm sorry that the eating disorder had to take over and that you heard the eating disorder speaking in his last words of life."

I don't think my dad was an anorexic like my aunt was--it was probably some other kind of wasting disease that made him lose all that weight. But(t) he was very weight focused about my size. You are kind!<br><br>Roddy, Thanks! You've made my morning!"

My father's side of the family is filled with bonafide anorexics.  
  
My Aunt Mary was a high-grade professional with the federal government her whole life, a single career lady. She had to shop in the little girls' department. At Eastertime, she'd snatch up all the little suits she could get her hands on, and try to make them mean business for the rest of the year. It wasn't easy.  
  
My Aunt Cathy gave birth to five children, and bragged that she never gained more than fifteen pounds during a pregnancy. That weight was lost in toto on the delivery table, and she'd wear her regular pedal pushers home from the hospital. What's that about?  
  
Cathy's idea of greeting me when she hadn't seen me for a few years was not a hug and a kiss, or even just a hello. It was to say, "I can tell you've *really* gained weight."  
  
Cathy did high-impact aerobics until past age seventy. The Thanksgiving before she died, she informed her children that she'd just eaten her last morsel. True to her word, she held out until February, and died weighing 75 pounds, her personal best. By then, of course, she was in a nursing home, because all her vital organs shut down from sheer starvation.  
  
My cousin, Cathy's daughter, told me after Cathy died that her mother had been a lifelong anorexic. You think?  
  
My father was 5'8", not tall by anyone's standards, but tall enough to support more than 120 pounds. Yet that was his weight for years before he died, down from his all-time high of 160 or so, when I was a little girl. I remember him at this high weight--it was his prime. He looked fabulous and strong and whole. When he was too thin, his idea of a special treat was a chocolate chip. *One* chocolate chip.  
  
He wore only heavy jogging suits the winter before he died in April, nineteen years ago. With all those clothes on, it was impossible to know the full extent of his hidden emaciation. He still had jowls, like always. It's the one enduring family feature that fools everyone. As it turned out, he didn't have much to hide.  
  
At his death, he weighed 90 pounds.  
  
Is it any wonder his last words to me were, "My God, your butt's getting big..."?  
  
Now if I could just stop looking in the mirror and hearing those words every flippin' day.
