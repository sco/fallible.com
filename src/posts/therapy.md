![Works for Me.](http://www.fallible.com/img/thumbnails/drphil.jpg)We'd heard rumors that Dr. Phil was staying in this very hotel over the weekend, but we were still shocked to walk into the lobby and find him seated there.  
  
He was sitting on a jewel-toned brocade couch, smack-dab in the middle, with fans/patients/admirers flanking him on either side. The other chairs in the arrangement were also occupied with women--all women--hanging on his every word.  
  
Dr. Phil was being more effervescent than I'd ever seen him on TV--he was clearly enjoying the attention.  
  
I couldn't help but notice that his diminutive wife, Robin, was not in the crowd.  
  
"There he is!" I said to Doug. Even my husband--no great believer in the benefits of psychological therapy--was impressed.  
  
And then it happened. Dr. Phil saw me standing there, left the crowd, and walked my way.  
  
"I recognize you from my studio audience," he said. "You looked like such a fascinating woman--a woman with a story. I really wanted to get a chance to talk to you...alone."  
  
Doug nodded his assent, and Dr. Phil led me to a quiet corner of the expansive lobby, where it was easier to hear the background music.  
  
"Shall we dance?" he asked.  
  
We danced a Texas slow dance and spoke like old, well-acquainted friends. We talked about our children, our work, my iffy self-esteem--but not of his wife or of my husband. Doug watched from a distance until he couldn't bear it anymore.  
  
I jumped when he placed his hand firmly on my shoulder, snapping back to reality so quickly that I felt guilty before even being accused.  
  
"I'm sorry," I said, "that I was dancing with Dr. Phil. But it *wasn't* like when I had dinner a couple weeks ago with Simon Cowell--this time, you said it was *OK*..."  
  
As betrayed as he must have felt, Doug still managed to deliver the classic Dr. Phil comeback.  
  
"*So*," he said, sounding a little bit jealous, "how's that working for him?"  
  
And then we kissed, rolled over, and laughed ourselves back to sleep.
