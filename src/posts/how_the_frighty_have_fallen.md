Back in the day (and I'm talkin' THE day, which means, obviously, the sixties), we took Halloween very seriously.  
  
Of course, I grew up Catholic and back then at least, Catholic kids were taught that All Hallow's Eve--the eve of All Saints Day, which is today--was a night for driving out evil spirits before the Holy Day. With that religious instruction firmly established, who wouldn't want to dress up as scary as unhumanly possible?  
  
It was all for the saints, in my day.  
  
No wonder I felt guilty the night I donned my Brenda Starr costume. In essence, I was betraying my spiritual tradition. I wore a shirtdress cinched tight at the waist with a crinoline petticoat underneath, lending the illusion of womanly hips. I layered on the bracelets and pearls and earrings and even hose and heels--those cute little 1" French heels were the style.  
  
The mask was the piece de resistance, the only glamorous mask in all of Katz Drug Store, with its flaming flipped tresses and cobalt blue eye shadow. The luscious lips had a tiny slit through which to breath--ever so shallowly--and to make lady- newspaper-reporter-like requests for nickel Hershey bars and candy necklaces.  
  
Brenday Starr, my eye. In my Catholic neighborhood, filled with the faithful--pirates, skeletons, witches, ghosts--it was assumed I was the area streetwalker. All that was missing was my pimp.  
  
There were no prohibitions against wearing our scary stuff to school, either. The more dreadful the Halloween, the nuns said, the happier the saints would be the next day. If I remember right, even November 2, All Souls Day, figured into our theology. If we dressed as ghoulies and ghousties and things that go bump in the night, the pour souls in purgatory (where we would soon enough find ourselves, completely dependent upon the generous novenas and horrifying costumes of those we left behind) would be scared right into heaven.  
  
You can imagine how, after the high theatrics and religious fervor of my impresionable youth, I am dismayed with the blase manner in which Halloween has unwound these past few decades. By the time my own unfortunate children came of age, they attended Christian schools and I discovered--to my horror--that they were required to dress as heroes of the Bible.  
  
Not just any biblical characters, mind you, since we all know where that might lead--some smart-alec kid would show up as Lazarus just raised from the dead, still wrapped like a mummy and stinking to high heaven. And then there's the kid who'd claim to be the naked demoniac or the sultry Bathsheba about to step into her hot tub.  
  
So Christian children everywhere were reduced to Matthew, Mark, Luke, John or one of the several Marys--as long as it wasn't Magdalene before she got saved.  
  
These days, even the public schools are bastions of supernatural correctness. This year, one school forbade anyone to dress as a witch. Not because it's too frightening, but because the school (and I assume, the ACLU) doesn't want to offend....witches.  
  
Things have gotten out of hand. What about the conventional wisdom of keeping Halloween as a prelude to the veneration of the saints, people? And what about the poor souls in purgatory?  
  
Is nothing sacred?
