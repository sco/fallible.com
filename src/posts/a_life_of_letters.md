      From a German who sees numbers and letters both in terms of the space they occupy and their potential for efficiency: yes, because online banking has yet to be instantaneous, which my checkbook register is.

"What did you love as a child? When you love it again, you will find your bliss."  
  
As a child, I loved letters. In kindergarten, I loved the printed alphabet hung high above the blackboard, loved it so much I wanted a border of it in my bedroom. Imagine my delight a couple of years later when the block letters became cursive, when the struggle to form words letter by detached letter became an easy flow--letters into words into sentences into stories.  
  
With advanced age and increased responsibility came the tyranny of numbers. As if addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division weren't enough, I became enslaved to algebra, geometry, trigonometry, and even calculus. Beloved books and prized poems fell by the wayside as the supposed critical importance of numbers played itself out in my psyche.  
  
I took a dreadful job just out of high school. A right-handed job, keypunching nine-digit numbers all day, filling orders without words for customers without names. In my few spare moments, I desperately pencilled poetry onto data entry cards. I furtively wrote love letters to the man of my dreams. I surreptitiously designed greeting cards for my co-workers.  
  
I slowly died for want of words, but I learned my lesson, and it is this: Hang on to your first love. But if perchance you let it go, do not rest until you have it once again in your hand and in your heart.  
  
If it is words you love, pursue them, for you will never be truly happy living a life of numbers.  
  
Besides, with online banking, does anyone really balance his checkbook anymore?
