    text: "Whoa, Simon! I was reading your site (which I just discovered a couple days ago) when you were commenting on mine! I don't do \"retail\" therapy. But I sometimes do wholesale therapy, and I often do 90% off therapy. I love your site!"

It was a bit of a drive, and so to save gas in my 79 T-Bird (getting, oh, 3 gallons to the MILE) I would usually go hang at Town Center Plaza B&N for a while, and then go sit and read/write at that Starbucks, til the evening college group. :) I'm back in the States for the month of July, though only part of that in KC....I'll be in STL and a doing to road trip to Texas too. Not far away, Katy... we'll have to meet up!"

    text: "Michaela, That's MY b&n, and MY Starbucks is 121st and State Line, to be precise. Now there's one in Lee's Summit, on 291. Hey, if we can meet to say \"hi\" in July, I'd love it! I've never been to Heartland, but my cousin goes there and loves it. Visiting Scott's church on a Sunday night would be fun. It's in Westport, \"Jacob's Well.\" A great church."

    text: "Yeah, I have some friends and Jacob's Well, me and Scott have talked about that. :) Jacob's Well is sorta an \"offshoot\" of Heartland, too. And I did frequent that 291 Starbucks, too! Its kinda small...I preferred either the new Borders off 50 hiway or the Starbucks near Independence Center. <br>Ahh, I miss home!"

![Shop 'till you top](http://www.fallible.com/img/cart.gif)"I love your skirt," said the lady in line next to me at Starbucks. "Where did you get it?"  
  
You've got to know that "my" Starbucks is mere minutes away from the ritziest shopping district in Johnson County, Kansas.  
  
"Walmart," I answered, with a friendly smile.  
  
"Oh....well....I tried on one just like it at Talbot's, but it didn't fit right...."  
  
"Mine fits right," I said.  
  
"Ummm...I *kind* of like *Target*," she said, backing away.  
  
Was it something I said?
