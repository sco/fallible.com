      Fly little birdy, as the mother bird pushes the little bird out of the nest. Fly

      The thing I learned from my experience that surprised me most of all? My anxiety and fears on her behalf were matched only by her own for herself. But it was her worry about us - about me, mostly - that manifested itself in a million little ways and opened my eyes to the adult she'd grown into.  
        
      And then, I remembered feeling much the same way back when it had been me doing the flying away.

      Not related, but here is another quote for you:  
      "Do not go where the path may lead, go instead where there is no path and leave a trail." -- Ralph Waldo Emerson

      Michael--Parenting is fraught with paradox, isn't it? Sigh.  
        
      Lisa--You can call me anytime to commiserate. I am good at that!  
        
      Jennifer--You are right. I sense my son's anxiety. I am trying to dole out bits of the world's ways as he's needing them--how to control his food expenses, for instance. How to make sure you never have a late payment. How to use credit cards responsibly. He's paying attention these days, which makes me know he's, shall we say, "concerned."  
        
      Donna--I remember the day I moved out. My roommate (who was really just running away from her home life, and who had no job and no money) and I went shopping for all the odds and ends we needed to "set up housekeeping." A mop, toilet brush, detergent, toilet paper, sponges, cleaning supplies, a broom, and on and on. I wrote the check and thought, "Whoa. Real life ain't cheap." We try to warn out kids about everything, but do they actually believe us until they get out there? So we pray.  
        
      Kevin--Thanks! My husband is something of a trail-blazer, I think. I'll really be challenged to write on this quote, but we just might try it!

      When the first son left home, I bawled all the way back home from the greyhound station.  
      The baby we moved out on. He was starting  
      college and we had to transfer. It never gets  
      easy. No one tells us that the day they are born.

      Candace--We tossed out the idea of "moving out on" our youngest. We've toyed with the idea of renting out our house and living a couple of years in Northern Ireland. However, we have two mothers in assisted living, so we couldn't see our way clear...  
        
      And I sure would miss my kids!

It won't be long now. The signs are all falling into place.  
  
I hear him rustling through the cabinets, searching in vain for the one cereal he will still eat, but which I can never remember the name of when I'm at the store. Then he moves on to scrutinize the shelves of the fridge, and he mutters to himself--but also to me, I'm guessing--about how we're out of orange juice and the milk's getting iffy.  
  
There's plenty of stuff to eat in this house--that's not it. And I try--I really do--to remember to pick up his favorites when I'm out. But his tastes are changing, maturing. He's restless when he's here too long with just his dad and me, and it's useless for me to try to prevent or to outsmart the natural order of things.  
  
I wouldn't attempt it if I could.  
  
He's twenty years old. He'll get his own apartment soon. That's as it should be, I think.  
  
So I don't offer to iron his dress clothes for work very often anymore--he needs to take care of his own wardrobe. If he injures himself playing soccer and I'm worried that he's torn a ligament or worse, I don't overreact. Instead, I hear myself say something understated like, "Well, what do you think you should do?" He stares at me blankly for a minute before the lights flicker to life. "Go to the doctor?" he asks.  
  
Now he's in my bathroom foraging for hair products. We're separated by one thin wall and I feel his frustration as he bangs around in the closet.  
  
"It would be nice if we had one can of hair spray that actually worked," he says from the next room.  
  
Growing up is never easy. Pulling away from everything you've known feels wonderful and horrible, all at once.  
  
"Why don't you buy what you want?" I ask.  
  
I cannot bear to withhold a single good thing from this child. But I do, and on purpose. It is time.  
  
"I don't want anything special," he says, banging the can on the counter. "I just want it to actually spray..."  
  
He's given us nothing but joy for twenty years. If I buy the man some awesome hair spray, he just might stay forever.  
  
"Your standards are pretty high," I say. "You should probably buy your own so you'll have what you want."  
  
We both know what's happening here. It was bound to happen; even from the first time I looked into his sparkling eyes, I've known it.  
  
"I just want it to spray..." he says again.  
  
It won't be long now. The signs are all falling into place.  
  
Our baby's leaving home.
