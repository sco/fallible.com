      Guess he was talking into your deaf ear, huh? :)

    text: "Yeah. And the weird thing is that I've feel I've been talking into his deaf ear lately, too. Oh, wait...he doesn't have one! Just kidding. Actually, I'm signing the dude up for an audiology exam. He's had some significant hearing slippage recently, unless I'm misreading the symptoms. Rock music is a lot of fun while it lasts, though!"

Our darling daughter Carrie is finishing a degree this spring (yea, Carrie!) and working at the hospital near the university. She doesn't come home too often these days (once every six weeks or so), and I try to save housework for her, at her request. It's a way for her to make a few bucks and a way for me to save my back. She does a fine job of it, too; it's just that I'm never quite sure when she'll be here next, or exactly how much work to actually set aside for her.  
  
For a couple of years, I had cleaning chicks come regularly once a month. It took some pressure off me so that I could devote more attention to my mom and mom-in-law, and my writing. But when I lost my girls a year ago to the fair state of Missouri's criminal justice system, my house went south in a hurry.  
  
Since then, certain things have been, let's just say, building up. I must be feeling guilty about the build-up, or I wouldn't have so readily misinterpreted Doug's comment this morning.  
  
"I liked it when we had cleaners come."  
  
Listen, buddy: Cleaner scum will cost you extra!
