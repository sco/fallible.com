Our safe deposit box up at the bank contains a modest collection of gold and silver coins, mostly from the 1800's. When we began a program of acquiring these coins, it was psychologically difficult to shell out, say, $1000, for a coin with a face value of $20. But as similar coins disappear into vaults and scarcity sets in, the face value becomes less and less a part of the equation. Eventually, market conditions prevail, the price of precious metals goes up, and collectors are able to realize a healthy profit on their investments. The one thing the salespeople always tell us is that no matter how dismal markets might become, the value of our coins can never drop below face value. No matter what, our investment can never go to zero. Sometimes I wonder about myself, and hope I always deliver to my readers-even of my humble blog-bits of writing that give them a positive return on their investment of time and energy. If nothing else, I sure hope you'll take me at face value, and maybe think you got a heck of a deal.
