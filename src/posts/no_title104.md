I'm a voracious reader and book accumulator. I acquire everything from the lowly mass- market paperback, to the less-homely trade paperback, to first edition clothbound hardcovers, to antique copies of the classics. All books are not created equal. With books intended for the mass-market and trade audience, I edit. Before I open the cover, I've got pen in hand, ready to proofread, mark-up and cast dispersion on the plotline, character development, theme, structure, author and publisher. And, after that, maybe even upon life in general. The benefit of the doubt is usually extended to any book that has the exalted good fortune to make it into hardback. I find myself jotting my own clever musings alongside the author's, yes. But in pencil, rather than in indelible ink, and lightly-and always using a pencil with a good eraser on the other end. It occurs to me with these books that my opinion might be wrong, so I make sure my expression of it is reversible. It occurs to me that these authors have proven value, both in the publishing marketplace and in the marketplace of ideas. It even occurs to me that if my stories were better than theirs, they'd be marking up my books, instead of the other way around. It's the old books, the valuable ones, the classics, which I rarely touch. Some have been in my family for a hundred years or longer, and are brittle with age and handling. I hesitate to move them even to relieve the burden of dust that settles in sorry layers upon the edges. The slightest brush upon such a delicate surface might inflict irreparable damage, so they sit for years, for decades, unread. Surely the writer wanted these books to be read and enjoyed for as long as they endure! Still, I hesitate, I pull back, I miss out on the message out of respect for the package. Sometimes, I wonder if the people in my life aren't sorted in much the same way as the books. And I picture the Publisher sadly shaking His head, and wishing I'd read. Just read.
