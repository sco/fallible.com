      This is so true, Katy. And I find if I don't act on the thought or impulse (the Holy SPirit nudging me), I miss an opportunity.  
      Have I told you lately how much I love your writing? What a blessing it has been to add you to the list of people I care about (and we haven't even met, but we have the birthday thing and the Irish thing). Be blessed today, sweet friend...

      I don't even know how I stumbled upon your page, all my weaving about the internet tonight. But, I am called to write a book, and, in my fear, wondering what I would have to say that would touch others. I read the FB comment you received and the light bulb went off-no matter what I write, it will be meaningful to others because God has called me to write it and my words will be filled with love.  
      Thank you for your lovely site.

I do regard them. Writers, (good writers) get \"revelation\" from God who influence, they are really special people."

      I like this article. Not just this article, but many articles on this website. Programmers  
        
      are human too.  
        
      But some questions remain: what if the good job has a bad salary and vice-versa? This is a  
        
      frequent dilemma for many people.

Recently, I’ve received two completely unexpected notes from fallible readers. They didn’t arrive via the comments section (Um....it’s mostly spam, I’m afraid. Feel free to change that!), but rather in personal correspondence.

One letter started out with these words: “Two years ago, you sent me a letter of comfort over the loss of my parent....” Do you know how it feels when you don’t QUITE remember doing something, but suddenly feel awfully glad to know you did? That’s the emotion that came over me when I read this lovely note.

The writer went on to say she was sorry it had taken her so long to respond, but that my words had touched her and helped in in a time of need. I cried when I read this, because for me to be counted among those who even occasionally bless someone else with encouragement, comfort, joy, or empathy makes all my feeble attempts worthwhile.

The second letter came through a private facebook message. The writer described herself as a “long-time fallible reader,” but upon seeing her signature and her own blog address, I knew exactly who she was. How could I forget her? We have commiserated together over more than one of our shared life experiences---but admittedly, it had been a while.

She wrote to ask my advice on how to proceed with issues related to the care of an elderly parent. Of course, I am no expert, having only The Moms in my personal arsenal when it comes to acting as an advocate for the aged. But then she went on to say that even if I didn’t know the answer to her question, she wanted me to know how much my stories about our ladies had meant to her.

She appreciated the humor, the pathos, and the honesty with which I described the unfolding events of our lives. She said I had helped her as she referred back in her memory to some of my situations and applied them to the current difficulty she’s facing.

Again, I was completely astounded to receive such a letter. And blessed beyond what I can express here.

But this is what I want you to know: If you never write anything more than a sympathy card or a thank you note or a facebook comment, your writing means something. Your words touch others, affect their hearts and minds, bring them clarity, offer them wisdom, and---always most importantly---demonstrate your love.

Never underestimate the power of your words. Others are reading, and listening, and taking those words to heart. You’ll never hear from most of your readers. But every once in a while, one will reach out to you.

And then through your tears, you’ll remember all over again why you continue to write.
