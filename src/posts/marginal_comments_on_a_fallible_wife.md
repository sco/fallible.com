      Hey Katy! Congratulations to you and that coat tail riding husband of yours on both your 28th anniversary and on finding a new audience via this blurb. Looks like God is a better PR guy than you could possibly hire.

      Saw the article in the Writer's Digest magazine and it got me interested in maybe having a blog of my own to post my Bible essays. As yours has a Christian aspect thought I would check you out. Looks great.

![Writer's Digest Personal Writing](http://www.fallible.com/images/personalwriting.jpg)To any of you who are new visitors to fallible, as well as to Doug's blog [marginal](http://www.marginalcomments.com), and who found our sites through the article on blogging in the April issue of *Writer's Digest Personal Writing* magazine, welcome! I hope you discover something here to entertain, inspire, and motivate you in your own personal writing life.  
  
Please feel free to leave me a comment so I know who you are! I love to visit the blogs of my wonderful readers.  
  
And many thanks to [Mick Silva](http://mywritersgroup.typepad.com) for letting me know that the fallible/marginal blurb had run in Writer's Digest. It was a complete surprise to us!  
  
By the way, my 74-year-old mom recently let me know that [blogging is dead](http://www.fallible.com/2005_02_01_archive.html#110744937098500226), as evidenced by the fact that she hadn't seen my name or picture in a single newspaper or magazine article about blogging since last summer. She might as well have said, in other words, "Blogging is SO mid-2004..."  
  
Mom, I hope this renews your faith in both me and the future of the blogosphere!  
  
Sheesh. Even middle-aged with-it chick bloggers still need their dear old mom's approval. Some things never change.
